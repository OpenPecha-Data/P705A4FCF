I. Thus I heard: Once the Lord stayed at the Vulture Peak in Rājagṛha with a great congregation
of some five hundred monks and with eight thousand bodhisatvas (evaṃ mayā śrutam ekasmin
samaye bhagavān rājagṛhe viharati sma gṛdhrakuṭe parvate mahatā bhikṣusaṃghena sārdhaṃ
pañcamātrair bhikṣuśatair aṣṭābhiś1 ca bodhisatvasahasraiḥ).All [the bodhisatvas] were great
beings (mahāsatva) having acquired the power of retaining in memory (dhāraṇīpratilabdha)
and immeasurable eloquence (apramāṇapratibhāna), what discursive2 knowledge they might establish
is the noble knowledge (āryajñāna) of the three gates of liberation (vimokṣamukha),
their knowledge was unobstructed in the three worlds (trilokāpratihatajñāna), their concentration
(samādhi) was undisturbed, and they had perfected the ten powers and intrepidities
(daśabalavaiśāradyasaṃpanna).3

At that time, in the great city of Rājagṛha, lived the daughter of a courtesan called Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī4
, beautiful, charming and good-looking, she had the most abundant riches
of a beautiful complexion (tena khalu samayena rājagṛhe mahānagare suvarṇottaraprabhāśrī nāma
gaṇikāduhitā5 prativasaty abhirūpā prāsādikā darśanīyā paramayā śubhavarṇapuṣkalatayā
samanvāgatā6 ).By her former roots of good that girl had attained a colour of the body like
the colour of gold (tasyāś ca dārikāyāḥ pūrvakuśalamūlahetunā suvarṇavarṇaḥ kāyo ’bhiniṣpannaḥ),and
whatever place she was standing, sitting or walking would be illumined by the
splendour of that golden colour (yeṣu pṛthivīpradeśeṣu tiṣṭhaty api niṣaṇṇāpi gacchaty api
te ’pi suvarṇavarṇāvabhāsenāvabhāsitāḥ),and, whatever clothing she would put on, be it red
or white, would shine with a golden colour (yāni vastrāṇi tayā veṣṭhitāni lohitāni vāvadātāni
vā tāni ca sarvāṇi vastrāṇi suvarṇavarṇāny eva saṃdṛśyante).That girl was the beloved
and comforting friend of all people (sā ca dārikā sarvasya janakāyasya priyā viśvastamānasā),
and they could not get enough of looking at her (nirīkṣamāṇo na tṛptim upayāti).7She
had such a gentle speech (suvacāḥ), her speech was tender, soft, sweet and pleasant (sūratamṛdumadhurapriyavādinī),
and her face was smiling (smitamukhā), worthy of all respect (supradakṣiṇagrāhiṇī),
having no aggressions (apagatabhṛkuṭikā), no harshness (aparuṣā) or roughness
(akarkaśā);and all the young princes (rājaputra), the young sons of ministers (āmātyaputra),
young sons of bankers (śreṣṭhiputra), young sons of housholders (gṛhapatiputra)
in the great city of Rājagṛha desired her excessively, having their minds bent on her they
did not know how to see her enough.And wherever that daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī
went, be it to gardens, to rivers, lotus-ponds (udyānanadīpuṣkariṇī), to houses,
roads, to the marketplace (gṛharathyāntarāpaṇa), men and women, boys and girls (naranārīdārakadārikāḥ)
assembled and followed her (tasyāḥ pṛṣṭhato ’nubaddhāḥ) out of curiosity (kautūhalaprāptāḥ).

Then a son of a banker (śreṣṭhiputra) named Bhayadatta got hold of Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī, the
daughter of a courtesan, by means of riches.Setting out for a garden (udyānabhūmau niryāntau)
they sat down on a nice seat which had been prepared (prajñapta eva svāsane niṣaṇṇau)
in a cart with four horses, decorated with jewels, pearls, cats-eye gems and gold (maṇimuktikāvaiḍūryasuvarṇasvalaṃkṛta),
carrying raised parasols, flags and banners (samucchritacchattradhvajapatāka),
adorned with flowers, incense, perfume, aromatic powder and garlands
(puṣpadhūpagandhacūrṇamālopaśobhita), with windows adorned with campaka-flowers (campakamālāvātāyana).And
thus, with the intention of playing and having fun (ratikrīḍāśayena), before
the cart people were leading it on with cymbals, drums, (rathasya purato tūryatāḍāvacarasaṃgītipravādena
nīyamānaḥ), and those following it carried all kinds of things for enjoyment
and pleasure (tasya rathasya pṛṣṭhataḥ sarvâpabhogaparibhogadhāry anusārī). The great
crowd of people followed with thoughts set on seeing the object of their curiosity, and
they thus arrived in the garden (mahājanakāyaḥ kautūhaladarśanāśayaḥ pṛṣṭhato ’nubaddha udyānabhūmim
upajagāma).
