That son of a banker, since his roots of good were not yet matured, did not know the teaching
which the princely Mañjuśrī had taught that girl, as he had not heard it (aśrutā ca na jñātā
tena śreṣṭhiputreṇāparipakvakuśalamūlena mañjuśriyaḥ kumārabhūtasya tasyai dārikāyai
dharmakathā).But by the magical presence of the princely Mañjuśrī the the following verses
resounded from all the trees in the park (atha mañjuśriyaḥ kumārabhūtasyādhiṣṭhānena sarve
tasyodyānasya vṛkṣā gāthā bhāṣanti sma):

1) The whole world is non-existent (abhūta), it is like seeing a magical creation (māyādarśana),
but as the boy sees it, the moments of existence has an essential nature (svabhāva).2)
That which is clothed (vāsita) in flesh and blood deceives the childish (bāla), and having
made thought-constructions (vikalpya) in what is inexistent (abhūta), the foolish (akuśala)
and childish become impassioned (rakta).3) Like a foolish man goes along carrying a jar
with drawings on the surface, but full of ill-smelling matter,4) while he is walking along,
however, it falls down, and seeing the ill-smelling matter, he becomes without any passion
(arakta) and runs away, even though having been impassioned before,5) in the same way
the childish and foolish become mentally impassioned (rakta) – having made thought-constructions
(kalpitvā) of colour, beauty, and appearance they get impassioned by it (rajyante).6)
But you, my boy, should understand what is the essential nature of the body (kāyasvabhāva):
which wise man is impassioned (rajyate) by the rotten smell from a cementary?7) Do
not be afraid: there is no reason to be scared by the non existent (abhūta). You should rather
see the essential nature (svabhāva) of the things you were depressed (mūrchita) because
of before.8) There is a wonderful teacher of religion who clears away the fear of the scared,
a teacher whose name is “The Lion of the Śākyas” has appeared.9) Pleasure (kāma) is
impermanent (anitya) and not abiding (adṛḍha), it is like a flash of lightening (vidyutprabhā),
though it shines forth it is no real (abhūta), and the wise are not attached to it.10)
As bubbles and foam (phenapiṇḍa) arise from troubled water connected to certain causal
activity (kāraṇaprayukta) but with no acting subject (kartṛ) there,11) in the same way names
and form (nāmarūpa) arise connected to actions (karmaprayukta), since they stem only from
such causal activity (kāraṇa), there is no acting subject (kartṛ) there.12) Where is the
beautiful colour gone? And where do the impurities by which you were just now so scared
come from? That, my boy, you should realize.13) The moments of existence (dharma) are not
found in the outside world (viṣaya), and they do not come from any of the directions (pradeśa).
But even though they are beyond coming and going (āgatigati), you shoud see their essential
nature (svabhāva).14) There is no subject acting (kartṛ) or feeling (vedaka), and
the moments of existence being without an acting or feeling subject is like an illusion (māyāvad)
and not an existent thing (avastuka).15) Understand your own body in this way, and
you should not be scared because of the body of another.16) Just as the amorous play and
pleasure in a dream: all amorous pleasure and play (ratikriḍā) is like the amorous play experienced
in a dream.17) So, my boy, go to the Lion of the Śākyas, and he will tear you terror
and fear (trāsabhaya) up with its roots.18) Your father and mother are not anymore your
protection (śaraṇa), and not your friends (mitra) and relatives (bandhu). When they have
left you, how can you do what you wish (yathāśaya)?19) So go for protection (śaraṇa) to
the One clearing away the fear of the frightened, the Awakened who is the protection of the
unprotected (aśaraṇaśaraṇa), and to Religion, and to the elect Assembly.20) Those who go
to him for protection – be they from the gods, the celestial musicians or from men – they
are liberated from all fear, and happiness is not hard for them to obtain.
