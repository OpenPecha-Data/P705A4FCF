At that time the Lord was walking with his attendant the venerable monk Ānanda in the mountain
forest (girikuñja) on the slopes of the Vulture Peak (gṛdhrakūṭaparvatatala), and then
sat down. Having sat down he addressed the princely Mañjuśrī:“Mañjuśrī, the way you taught
the bodhisatva’s assumption of vigour (vīryasamādāna) and ability in expedient means (upāyakauśalya),
that is just the way they are, it is very good, very good!”By that word “Very
good” the whole system of threefold thousand great thousand world spheres was filled with
the sound, and by that word “Very good” the whole system of threefold thousand great thousand
sixfold world spheres were moved, and gods, snakegods, demons, heavenly musicians, giants,
celestial birds, man-horses, great snakes, men and not men, the king of the gods, the
creator and many protectors of the world were incited by that word “Very good” and went
to the the place where the Lord stayed, greeted him by bowing the head to the feet of the
Lord and sat down at one side.Having sat down, the gods, snakegods, demons, heavenly musicians,
giants, celestial birds, man-horses, great snakes, men and not men, the king of the
gods, the creator and many protectors of the world said to the Lord: “To whom did the Lord
express the word “Very good”, by which the whole system of threefold thousand great thousand
world spheres was filled with the sound?” The Lord said: “Sons of gods, it was to the
princely Mañjuśrī.”The sons of gods said: “Lord, where does the princely Mañjuśrī stay now?”
The Lord said: “Sons of gods, the princely Mañjuśrī stays at the eastern gate of the great
city Rājagṛha engaged in religious conversation with the daughter of a courtesan called
Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī, so the sons of gods who wishes to listen to the religion should go
there.”Then all those gods, snakegods, demons, heavenly musicians, giants, celestial birds,
man-horses, great snakes, men and not men, the king of the gods, the creator and many
protectors of the world assembled and went to where the princely Mañjuśrī stayed, and having
manifested themselves in gross bodies and made it rain with flowers, and by that rain of
flowers bunches of flowers were spread all over the neighbourhood (parisamanta) of Rājagṛha.There
the gods could see the men and men could see the gods, but they did not expostulate
with each other. And many hundred thousand beings from the great city of Rājagṛha, having
been incited by those flowers, having been incited by those visible bodies of the gods
(devaudārikakāya), went to where the princely Mañjuśrī stayed.The king Ajātaśatru – surrounded
by his retinue of women, with his armed forces of four classes (caturaṅgabala), with
great royal richness and great royal might (mahārājānubhava) – also went to where the princely
Mañjuśrī stayed, and the retinue, the king, the ministers, the sons of the ministers,
the traders, the sons of the householders saw that daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī
freed from the manifestation of the vice desire (rāgakleśaparyutthāna), her senses
and behaviour were calm (praśāntendriyeryāpatha), and her senses were not disturbed (atandritendriya),
full of shame, adorned with beauty (śrīsamalaṃkṛtā). And having seen her, the
mental construction of desire (rāgavikalpa) did not afterwards arise in them.
