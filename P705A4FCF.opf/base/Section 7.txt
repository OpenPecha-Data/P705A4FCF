Then the princely Mañjuśrī, having seen that great crowd of people (mahājanakāya), said to the
daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī: “My child (dārike), even though seeing this
great crowd of people you are not any more filled with desire, so where have you disposed
of your vices (kleśa)?”The girl said: “The vices, Mañjuśrī, of all beings are placed within
knowledge and liberation, placed within the totality of moments of existence (āha sarvasatvānāṃ
kleśā jñānavimokṣasthitā dharmadhātusthitā), and I have understood them thus as
without origination, without destruction without change (te caivaṃ mayānutpannāniruddhāvikṛtā
avabuddhāḥ), this essential nature of the vices is what I have understood (yaḥ kleśasvabhāvaḥ
sa tu mayāvabuddhaḥ).”Mañjuśrī said: “My child, what is the essential nature of
vices (mañjuśrīr uvāca kleśasvabhāvo dārike katamaḥ)?”The girl said: “The essential nature
beyond construction and thought-construction, Mañjuśrī, is the essential nature of the vices
(akalpāvikalpasvabhāvo mañjuśrīḥ kleśasvabhāvaḥ); the fundamentally unborn essential nature
is the essential nature of the vices (yoniśo’nutpannasvabhāvaḥ kleśasvabhāvaḥ); the
vices are adventitious, they do not stay on with the understanding of emptiness (āgantukāḥ
kleśā na śūnyatādhigamena sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti); they do not stay on with knowledge of the
absence of distinguishing marks and the absence of wishful thinking (nānimittāpraṇdhānajñānena
sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti); they do not stay with the originally pure light (na prakṛtiprabhāsvareṇa
sārdhaṃ saṃvasanti).Just like, Mañjuśrī, a man is killed in a minute by a venomous
(viṣogra) snake (āśīviṣa), but if a man eats the drug called Agada, which neutralizes all
poison (sarvaviṣaghna) and passifies all poison (sarvaviṣapraśamana), then, as soon as the
drug is administered, the poison of the venomous snake (āśīviṣaviṣa) is made to nought,
and boys and girls can play with it. Playing with the snake they adopt it (kroḍīkṛ-) and
binds it with ornaments (pārśvasūtraka), but even though they adorn it it does not hurt (na
dahati) or bite (na bhakṣayati) or inflict harm upon anybody (na duḥkhayati).In the same
way, Mañjuśrī, I had not heard of the discipline of religion before and was burnt by the
vices brought about by superficial mental activity and misunderstandings (evam eva mañjuśrīr
aham aśrutapūrvadharmavinayāyoniśomanasikāraviparītopasthitaiḥ kleśaiḥ paridagdhā), attached
to my own body by desire (rāgeṇa svakāyasaktā), attached to my beauty (svarūpābhiniviṣṭā),
and I did not reflect on (pratyavekṣ-) the fact that beauty (rūpa) is just like foam
(phenopama); I did not understand that the body (kāya) has the nature of an illusion (māyopama),
I did not understand that playing with pleasures (ratikrīḍā) is like a dream (svapnopamā),
I did not understand that the taste of the pleasure of desire (kāmaratyāsvāda) is
like a drop of honey (madhu), I did not understand that the life-principle (jīvitendriya)
is like dew-drops (avaśyāyabindhūpama), I did not understand that all composite things (saṃskāra)
are impermanent (anitya), I did not understand that the body is impure (aśubha),
I did not understand that all composite things (saṃskāra) are intense suffering (atyantaduḥkhita),
and I did not reflect on (pratyavekṣ-) the fact that all moments of existence are
without self-substance (anātma). I was thus myself obscured by darkness and also obscured
others (ahaṃ ca tamo’ndhakārāvṛtā parāñ cāndhīcakāra), I was bound myself and bound others
(ahaṃ ca baddhā parāñ ca babandha).When I, Mañjuśrī, heard your speech on religion, and
having heard it got faith in it, having got faith in it I was freed (yadā mañjuśrīr ahaṃ
tvaddharmakathāṃ śrutā śrutvā cādhimuktādhimucya ca vimuktā), so I will not, neither in the
present, nor in the future, look upon anyone with desirous eyes (tasmān nāhaṃ kaṃcid sāmpratam
āyatyāṃ vā raktacakṣuṣā drakṣyāmi).And why? Mañjuśrī, light does not coexist with darkness
(tat kasya hetoḥ, na mañjuśrīr ālokas tamobhiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati), and, in the same
way, Mañjuśrī, no one without vices is attached to the vices (evam eva mañjuśrīr na kaścid
vigatarāgaḥ kleśai raktaḥ).

Then the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī said to the princely Mañjuśrī:Please
Mañjuśrī, since these great congregations of gods and men are assembled here, be eloquent
in your religious speech so that these gods and these men produce the thought of the absolute
incomparable awakening out of compassion for the living beings, that after having understood
the essential nature of the vices (he mañjuśrīr asya devaparṣado mānuṣyaparṣadaś ca
saṃnipatitatvād evaṃ dharmakathāyai pratibhātu te yena ete devā mānuṣyāś ca kleśasvabhāvam
avabudhya satveṣu kāruṇyenānuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpādayiṣyanti).Mañjuśrī said:
But sister, the essential nature of the vices is very difficult to reach (duradhimocya
bhagini kleśasvabhāvaḥ). And why? Because the essential nature of the vices is awakening
(tat kasya hetoḥ, kleśasavbhāvo bhagini bodhiḥ).

1) Just like, sister, a fire not ignited does not have the nature of burning, in the same way,
sister, the vice which is not imagined does not have the nature of existence (tadyathā
bhagini nāgnir ajāto dāhanātmakaḥ, evam eva bhagini na kleśo ’parikalpitaḥ saṃsārātmakaḥ).2)
Just like, sister, a fire which is ignited has the nature of burning, in the same way,
sister, the vice which is imagined has the nature of existence (tadyathā bhaginy agnir jāto
dāhanātmakaḥ, evam eva bhagini kleśaḥ parikalpitaḥ saṃsārātmakaḥ).3) Just like, sister,
if the fire has a cause it burns, in the same way, sister, if the vices have the cause of
the manifestation of viewpoints it burns in the three spheres of existence (tadyathā bhagini
hetuko ’gnir jvalati, evam eva bhagini dṛṣṭiparyutthānahetukāḥ kleśās traidhātuke jvalati).4)
Just like, sister, if the fire has no cause it does not burn, in the same way, sister,
if the vices does not have the cause of the manifestation of viewpoints it does not burn
in the three spheres of existence (tadyathā bhagini nāhetuko ’gnir jvalati, evam eva bhagini
na dṛṣṭiparyutthānāhetukāḥ kleśās traidhātuke jvalati).5) Just like, sister, there is
no increase or decrease in the thousand year fire, in the same way, sister, there is no
increase or decrease in the vices committed during a hundred thousand world-ages (tadyathā
bhagini na varṣasaharsāgner upacayāpacayaḥ, evam eva bhagini na kalpaśatasahasracaritakleśānām
upacayāpacayaḥ).6) Just like, sister, an extinguished fire cannot be called a fire,
in the same way, sister, vices at peace cannot be called vices (tadyathā bhagini na praśāntāgnir
agniḥ prajñapyate, evam eva bhagini na praśāntakleśaḥ kleśaḥ prajñapyate).7) Just like,
sister, though fire burns in open space it cannot burn the space, in the same way, sister,
though the adventitious vices arise in the originally luminous, they are not able to
pollute the originally luminous (tadyathā bhagini yatra ākāśe agnir jvalati na so ’gnir ākāśaṃ
dagdhuṃ śakyate, evam eva bhagini yatra prakṛtiprabhāsvara āgantukakleśā utpannā api
na te kleśās tat prakṛtiprabhāsvaraṃ saṃkleśayituṃ śakyante).

1) But even though that is the case, sister, how should the body of form be regarded (evam api
bhagini kathaṃ rūpakāyo draṣṭavyaḥ)? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, just like the reflection
of the moon in a small lake (āha yathā mañjuśrīr hradodakāntara udakacandraḥ).2) Mañjuśrī
said: How, girl, should the parts of personality be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī,
the manifestation of the Real Being (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike skandhā draṣṭavyāḥ,
āha yathā mañjuśrīs tathāgatasya nirmāṇaḥ).3) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl, should the spheres
of sense-perception be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, the three spheres
of existence when consumed by the fire of the world-age (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike
dhātavo draṣṭavyāḥ, āha yathā mañjuśrīḥ kalpāgniparidagdhaṃ traidhātukam).4) Mañjuśrī said:
How, girl, should the fields of sense-perception be regarded? The girl said: Just like,
Mañjuśrī, an action to be formed as unformed (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārika āyatanāni draṣṭavyāni,
āha yathā mañjuśrī anabhisaṃskṛtam abhisaṃskartavyaṃ karma ).5) Mañjuśrī said: How,
girl, should this congregation be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, the empty
space above us (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārika iyaṃ parṣad draṣṭavyā, āha yathā mañjuśrīr
uparivihāyo’ntarikṣam).6) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl, should you be regarded? The girl said:
Just like, Mañjuśrī, a meeting between my mother and father (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike
tvaṃ draṣṭavyā, āha yathā mañjuśrīr mātāpitṛsamāgamanam).7) Mañjuśrī said: How, girl,
should I be regarded? The girl said: Just like, Mañjuśrī, the seeing of a form of a blind
(mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike ’haṃ draṣṭavyāḥ, āha yathā mañjuśrīr anadhakasya rūpadarśanam).8)
Mañjuśrī said: Girl, are these teachings heard by you? The girl said: They are heard,
Mañjuśrī, as the aural information of a magically created [man] (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā
dārika ime dharmāḥ śrutāḥ, āha yathā mañjuśrīr māyānirmitasya śrotravijñaptyā śrutāḥ).9) Mañjuśrī
said: Girl, do you wish to reach the incomparable complete awakening? The girl said:
Mañjuśrī, since I am the awakening myself I do not need to wish for it once more (mañjuśrīr
uvāca tvaṃ dārike ’nuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhim icchasi, dārikovācāham eva mañjuśrīr bodhir
na punar icchāmi).10) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you practiced the perfection of giving?
The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have practiced it by completely giving away my vices (mañjuśrīr
uvāca tvayā dārike dānāpāramitā caritā, āha mayā mañjuśrīḥ sarvakleśātyantaparityāgena caritā).11)
Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you fulfilled the perfection of morality? The girl said:
Mañjuśrī, I have fulfilled it in the way of filling up empty space (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā
dārike śīlapāramitā paripūritā, āhākāśaparipūranayā mañjuśrīḥ paripūritā).12) Mañjuśrī
said: Girl, have you cultivated the perfection of tolerance? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have
cultivated it by means of the unbornness and absence of all beings (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā
dārike kṣāntipāramitā bhāvitā, āha sarvasatvānutpādābhāvena mañjuśrīr bhāvitā).13) Mañjuśrī
said: Girl, have you undertaken the perfection of vigour? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I
have undertaken it by the principle that all moments of existence are beyound reach (mañjuśrīr
uvāca tvayā dārike vīryapāramitārabdhā, āha sarvadharmāprāptinayena mañjuśrīr ārabdhā).14)
Mañjuśrī said: Girl, are you established in the perfection of meditation? The girl
said: Mañjuśrī, I am established by the principle that total reality is not established (mañjuśrīr
uvāca tvayā dārike dhyānapāramitāvasthitā, āha dharmadhātvanavasthānayena mañjuśrīr
aham avasthitā).15) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you fulfilled the perfection of insight?
The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have fulfilled it in the way that there is no rest (mañjuśrīr uvāca
tvayā dārike prajñāpāramitā paripūritā, dārikovācānadhikaṃ mañjuśrīḥ paripūritā).16)
Mañjuśrī said: Girl, have you cultivated the friendliness? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, I have
cultivated it by the principle that all beings are non-existent (mañjuśrīr uvāca tvayā dārike
maitrī bhāvitā, āha sarvasatvābhāvanayena mañjuśrīr bhāvitā).17) Mañjuśrī said: Girl,
from where is great compassion to be sought by the bodhisatva? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, great
compassion is to be sought by the bodhisatva from the vices of all beings. Why? If the
vices of all beings did not exist, the bodhisatva would not produce the thought of awakening
(mañjuśrīr uvāca mahākaruṇā dārike yato bodhisatvena paryeṣṭavyā, āha mahākaruṇā mañjuśrīr
bodhisatvena sarvasatvānāṃ kleśebhyaḥ paryeṣṭavyā. tat kasya hetoḥ. sarvasatvānāṃ kleśā
yadi na bhaveyur bodhisatvo ’nuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau na cittam utpādayet).18) Mañjuśrī
said: Girl, from where is joy to be sought by the bodhisatva? The girl said: Mañjuśrī,
joy is to be sought by the bodhisatva from the thought of awakening characterized by great
determination (mañjuśrīr uvāca muditā dārike yato bodhisatvena paryeṣṭavyā, āha muditā mañjuśrīr
bodhisatvenādhyāśayasahagatād bodhicittāt paryeṣṭavyā).19) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, what
does the equanimity of the bodhisatva effect? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, the equanimity
of the bodhisatva fulfils true speech towards all beings and demonstrates the absence of aversion
towards any moments of existence (mañjuśrīr uvāca bodhisatvasyopekṣā dārika kiṃ karoti,
āha bodhisatvasyopekṣā mañjuśrīḥ sarvasatveṣv avisaṃvādanatāṃ paripūrayati sarvadharmeṣv
aprativirodhatāṃ copadarśayati).20) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, what are the ones filled with
aversion? The girl said: Those, Mañjuśrī, who have entered awakening trying to get rid of
the vices which really are inexistent (mañjuśrīr uvāca katame dārike prativiruddhā iti,
āha ye ’bhūtakleśaprahāṇāya bodhipraviṣṭāḥ).21) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, to whom are they averse?
The girl said: To all with other views (mañjuśrīr uvāca te dārike kena prativiruddhā,
āha sarvaparapravādibhiḥ).22) Mañjuśrī said: But, girl, who are the ones with other views?
The girl said: Those who speak to others with conceited thoughts of tolerance (mañjuśrīr
uvāca katame dārike parapravādinaḥ, āha ye kṣāntimanyanayā parān pravadanti).23) Mañjuśrī
said: Girl, where does tolerance come from? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, it comes from being hurt
by all beings. Why? If one is not hurt there is no tolerance. One who unperturbed does
not hurt anyone, even though hurt by all beings, he has cultivated tolerance (mañjuśrīr uvāca
kasmād dārike kṣāntir ity āgatā, āha sarvasatvaviheṭhanāyā mañjuśrīr āgatā. tat kasya
hetoḥ. nāviheṭhanāyāṃ kṣāntiḥ kācid bhavet. yo mañjuśrīḥ sarvasatvaviheṭhanāyām aprakupito
na viheṭayati sa kṣāntibhāvitaḥ).24) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, what is aversion like? The girl
said: Mañjuśrī, because it destroys the roots of good collected for a hundred world ages,
that is why it is called aversion (mañjuśrīr uvāca katamo dārike pratigha iti, āha yena
mañjuśrīḥ kalpaśatopacitaṃ kuśalamūlaṃ pratihanti tenocyate pratigha iti).125) Mañjuśrī said:
Girl, what is absence of aversion ? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, the one without negative
thoughts does not harm any field of sense perception, he is [also] to be known as tolerant
(mañjuśrīr uvāca katamo dārike ’pratigha iti, āha yo mañjuśrīr apratihatacitto na sarvaviṣayān
pratihanti sa kṣānta iti veditavyaḥ).26) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how does the bodhisatva
become victorious in the battle? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, he discerns all moments of existence
but does not apprehend them (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike bodhisatvo vijitasaṃgrāmo
bhavati, āha yo mañjuśrīr vicīya sarvadharmān nopalabhate).227) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how
does a bodhisatva become a killer of the fiend, the Evil One? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, he
is one who does not get sullied even though he is one who subdues the Evil One (mañjuśrīr
uvāca kathaṃ dārike mārapratyarthikaghātako bhavati, āha yo mañjuśrīr na māradamako ’pi kliśyate).
Why? Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva shows the parts of his personality, but he does not
abide with the vices in the parts of personality (tat kasya hetoḥ, na bodhisatvo mañjuśrīḥ
skandhān darśayann api skandhakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati); and, Mañjuśrī, even though the
bodhisatva demonstrates vices, he is essentially and by his nature not attached to them
(bodhisatvo mañjuśrīḥ kleśān darśayann api svabhāvadharmatayāsaktaḥ); he demonstrates old
age and death to mature living beings, but he understands that all moments of existence are
beyond death and movement (satvaparipācanāya jarāmaraṇaṃ darśayann api sarvadharmān acyutanirgamanān
prabodhati); and even though, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva shows [these qualities]
as a son of a god, he is without all envy and conceit (bodhisatvo mañjuśrīr devaputro darśayann
api sarverṣyāmanyanāprahīṇaḥ).28) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how does the bodhisatva bring
living beings to maturity? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva brings beings to maturity
by cultivating insight and expedient means (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike bodhisatvaḥ
sattvān paripācayati, āha bodhisatvo mañjuśrīḥ prajñopāyaparibhāvanayā satvān paripācayati).29)
Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how does the bodhisatva stay in the nearness of all beings? The
girl said: Mañjuśrī, by cultivating his own thoughts and knowledge does he stay in the
nearness of all beings (mañjuśrīr uvāca kathaṃ dārike bodhisatvaḥ sarvasatvāntike tiṣṭhati,
āha svacittajñānaparibhāvito mañjuśrīr bodhisattvaḥ sarvasatvāntike tiṣṭhati).30) Mañjuśrī
said: Girl, is there in this congregation a wish to listen to your teachings? The girl
said: Mañjuśrī, in the one who has entered into the concept of self and others there is no
wish to listen, in the one who has entered into the consciousness of information derived
from hearing there is no wish to listen (mañjuśrīr uvāca iyaṃ dārike parṣat tvaddharmaṃ śuśrūṣamāṇā,
āha yasya mañjuśrīḥ parātmasaṃjñāpraveśaḥ so ’śruśrūṣamāṇo yasya śrotravijñaptivijñānapraveśaś
cāśruśrūṣamāṇaḥ).31) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, so what is the wish to listen to
religion? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, when one believes in one’s own body as in a man appearing
in a dream, when one believes in the teacher of religion as in a man created through magical
deception, when one believes in that religious teaching as in an echo, when there is
no duality of belief and liberation, that much is the wish to listen (mañjuśrīr uvāca katamā
dārike dharmasya śuśrūṣaṇatā, āha yadā mañjuśrīḥ svakāye yathāsvapnapuruṣādhimuktir dharmadeśake
yathāmāyāpuruṣādhimuktir tasyāṃ dharmadeśanāyāṃ yathāpratiśrutkādhimuktir adhimuktivimuktyor
advaidhīkāras tāvatī śuśrūṣaṇatā).32) Mañjuśrī said: Girl, how then should
the religious teaching be listened to? The girl said: Mañjuśrī, the religious teaching should
be listened to so that one progresses in the reliance on the religious teaching (mañjuśrīr
uvāca kathaṃ dārike dharmaḥ śrotavyaḥ, āha dharmapratisaraṇe pratipattyā dharmaḥ śrotavyaḥ).Then,
when the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī taught religion in that
way by means of the powerful precence of the princely Mañjuśrī and the insight resulting
from the roots of good which she had collected, twelve thousand beings in that congregation
produce the thought of the incomparable complete awakening, five hundred gods and men who
had collected roots of good as followers of the bodhisatva’s way attained the tolerance
that all things are unborn, and thirty two thousand beings attaind the impeccable pure sight
into the moments of existence (atha mañjuśriyaḥ kumārabhūtasyādhiṣṭhānena svakuśalamūlopacayaprajñayā
suvarṇottaraprabhāśriyā gaṇikāduhitayā tathā tathā dharma upadiśyamāne, tasyāṃ
parṣadi dvādaśaśataprāṇinām anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpāditāni, pañcaśatadevamānuṣyāṇāṃ
bodhisatvayānikānām pūrvakuśalamūlopacitānām anutpattikadharmakṣāntir upalabdhā,
dvātriṃśatyāḥ prāṇisahasrasya virajo vigatamalaṃ dharmacakṣur viśuddham).The girl attained,
by the joy and rapture resulting from hearing about religion, the kind of tolerance
which is in correspondence with the moments of existence (tasyā dārikayā dharmaśravaṇasya
prītyā prāmodyena dharmeṣv ānulomikī kṣāntir upalabdhā). Having attained it she fell down
before the feet of the princely Mañjuśrī, asking him for the ascetic life: “Out of compassion,
Mañjuśrī, allow me to enter the ascetic life, and release me from this body being made
up of the superficial, which is not noble and destroys the noble religion (sā kṣāntim
upalabhya mañjuśriyaḥ kumārabhūtasya pādayor nipatya, anukampām upādāya mañjuśrīḥ pravrājahi
mām, mocaya mām asmād ayoniśa’utpāditād anāryād āryadharmadūṣakāt kāyād iti pravrajyām
adhyaiṣata).
