Then, after the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī had given this teaching, she again
addressed the princely Mañjuśrī:How, Mañjuśrī, does the bodhisatva become free from vices
(kathaṃ mañjuśrīr bodhisatvo niṣkleśo bhavati)?Mañjuśrī said: Sister, the bodhisatva
who sees the vices in terms of originating and disappearing is not called a bodhisatva without
vices (mañjuśrīr uvāca yo bhagini bodhisatvaḥ kleśān utpadyamānān nirudhyamānān paśyati
sa na bodhisatvo niṣkleśa ucyate).Sister, if only darkness appears in an oil lamp, it cannot
really be called an oil lamp, in the same way, sister, the bodhisatva who sees the vices
in terms of originating and disappearing is not called a bodhisatva without all vices
(tadyathā bhagini yasmin tailapradīpe tamo’ndhakāraṃ pratibhāsate na sa tailapradīpa ucyate,
evam eva bhagini yo bodhisatvaḥ kleśān utpadyamānān nirudhyamānān paśyati sa na bodhisatvo
niṣkleśa ucyate). One without vices, sister, is called the one who does not see impurity
anywhere, who does not see purity, he is one without vices when he is beyond seeing and
non-seeing, beyond thought, mind and consciousness (niṣkleśa iti bhagini yo yatra na saṃkleśaṃ
paśyati na vyavadātaṃ paśyati, darśanādarśanacittamanovijñaptyapagato niṣkleśaḥ).Those,
sister, who anywhere foster the activity of thoughts, mind and consciousness – even the
thought of extinction – they all have vices (ye bhagini yatra cittamanovijñaptipravṛttaya,
antamaśo nirvāṇacittaṃ vā, sarve te kliṣṭāḥ).Why? For the one without vices there are
neither thought nor activity of thought (tat kasya hetor, na niṣkleśasya cittaṃ vā cittapravṛttir
vā).Those who foster thoughts having as the object good and bad, for all of them the
formative factors are active (yeṣāṃ kuśalākuśalārambaṇacittapravṛttis teṣāṃ sarveṣāṃ abhisaṃskāraḥ);
formative factors are the existence, and existence are the formative factors
(yo ’bhisaṃskāraḥ sa saṃsāraḥ, yaḥ saṃsāraḥ so ’bhisaṃskāraḥ); all the formative factors
are the existence, they, sister, are the vices (sarvasaṃskārāḥ saṃsāras te bhagini kleśāḥ).The
vices, sister, are attachment (kleśa iti bhagini tat saṃyojanam).The attachment of eye
and forms is vice (cakṣūrūpasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), as the attachement of ear and sound,
nose and smell, tongue and taste, body and tangibles, mind and moments of existence is vice
(evaṃ srotraśabdaghrāṇagandhajihvārasakāyaspraṣṭavyasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), the attachment
to morality is vice (śīlasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), the attachment to meditation is vice (samādhisaṃyojanam
hi kleśaḥ), the attachment to insight, liberation and the seeing of the knowledge
of liberation is vice (prajñāvimokṣavimokṣajñānadarśanasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ), the
attachment to isolation is vice (pravivekasaṃyojanam hi kleśaḥ).Absence of vice, sister, is
a designation for the absence of activity (niḥkleśa iti bhaginy apracārasyaitad adhivacanam),
absence of vice is a designation for the absence of discursive thinking (niḥkleśa iti
niḥprapañcasyaitad adhivacanam), absence of vice is a designation for the absence of effort
(niḥkleśa iti anābhogasyaitad adhivacanam), absence of vice is a designation for the absence
of purpose (niḥkleśa ity apracārasyaitad adhivacanam), the one without calculation
and non-calculation, sister, is without vices (gaṇanāgaṇanāviraho bhagini niḥkleśaḥ).

Further, sister, as the Tahāgata says, the one who himself is without vices, but strives to
release others from vices, he is to be called without vices (punar aparaṃ bhagini ya ātmani
niḥkleśaḥ parān ca kleśapramocanāya prayujyate so niḥkleśa iti tathāgatenoktam),so freeing
others from the vices is the bodhisatva’s adoption of vigour (parān kleśāt pramocanaṃ tu
bodhisatvasya vīryasamādanam).The girl said: Mañjuśrī, what is the bodhisatva’s adoption
of vigour (dārikovāca katamad mañjuśrīr bodhisatvasya vīryasamādanam)?Mañjuśrī said: Being
in accordance with reflection on emptiness but still having compassion for beings acting
according to viewpoints (mañjuśrīr uvāca śūnyatāpratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi dṛṣṭicariteṣu satveṣu
ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the absence of distinguishing marks
but still having compassion for beings acting according to distinguishing marks (ānimittapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi
nimittacariteṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with
reflection on the absence of wishful thinking but still having compassion for beings acting
according to wishful thinking (apraṇidhānapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi praṇidhānacariteṣu satveṣu
ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the absence of formative factors
but still having compassion for beings acting according to formative factors (anabhisaṃskārapratyavekṣānuvartanatâpy
abhisaṃskāracariteṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance
with reflection on the absence of birth and death but still having compassion for beings having
concepts of old age and death (jāticyutipratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi jarāmaraṇasaṃjñeṣu
satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection on the unbornness but still having
compassion for beings having concepts of origination and destruction (anutpadapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi
utpādavināśasaṃjñeṣu satveṣu ca kāruṇyam),being in accordance with reflection
on the devlopment of a disciple but still giving up the attainment of the fruit of the
disciple (śrāvakaniyāmapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi śrāvakaphalaprāptivyāvartanam),being in accordance
with reflection on the devlopment of an isolated buddha but still giving up the attainment
of the fruit of the isolated buddha (pratyekabuddhaniyāmapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi
pratyekabuddhaphalaprāptivyāvartanam),being in accordance with reflection on the development
of a bodhisatva but still having compassion with all beings (bodhisatvanyāmapratyavekṣānuvartanatāpi
sarvasatveṣu ca kāruṇyam),this, sister, the bodhisatva’s adoption of vigour
(idaṃ bhagini bodhisatvasya vīryasamādanam).

Just as, sister, it is easy to go into the ocean, but getting hold of the great pearls and return
is hard (tadyathā bhagini mahāsāgarapraveśaḥ sukaro mahāratnāny ādāya vyavartanaṃ duṣkaram).In
the same way, sister, to reflect on emptiness is easy, but returning from it is
difficult for the one without expedient means (evam eva bhagini śūnyatāpratyavekṣā sukaropāyarahitena
vyāvartanaṃ duṣkaram);to reflect on absence of distinguishing marks, wishful
thinking and formative factors, the absence of birth and origination, the way of development
of the disciples and the isolated buddhas is easy, but returning from it is difficult for
the one without expedient means (ānimittāpraṇihitānabhisaṃskārājātyanutpādaśrāvakanyāmapratyekabuddhanyāmapratyavekṣā
sukaropāyarahitena vyāvartanaṃ duṣkaram).Just as, sister, it
is easy to enter a great battle, but getting out without injuries and unhurt is hard. In
the same way, sister, to enter the three gates of liberation is easy, but returning is difficult
for the one without expedient means (tadyathā bhagini mahāyuddhapraveśaḥ sukaro ’vraṇitānupahatottarṇaṃ
duṣkaram, evam eva bhagini trivimokṣamukhapraveśaḥ sukara upāyarahitena
vyāvartanaṃ duṣkaram).The girl said: What, Mañjuśrī, are expedient means like?Mañjuśrī
said: Expedient means, sister, is not giving up the two opposite sides, that is, the side
of existence and the side of extinction (kīdṛśo mañjuśrīr upāya iti, mañjuśrīr uvāca, upāya
iti bhagini yad dvipakṣāprahāṇaṃ kiṃ tu saṃsārapakṣo nirvāṇapakṣaś ca).Expedient means,
sister, is demonstrating the dual gates (upāya iti bhagini yo mukhadvaysaṃdarśaṇaḥ), that
is, the gate of existence and the gate of extinction (saṃsāramukhaṃ nirvāṇamukhaṃ ca), the
gate of emptiness and the gate of freedom from viewpoints (śūnyatāmukhaṃ dṛṣṭivimokṣamukhaṃ
ca), the gate of absence of distinguishing marks and the gate of freedom from distinguishing
marks (ānimittamukhaṃ nimittavimokṣamukhaṃ ca), the gate of absence of no wishful thinking
aand the gate of being born according to one’s wish (apraṇidhānamukhaṃ saṃcintyopapattimukhaṃ
ca), the gate of absence of things formed and the gate of forming the good (anabhisaṃskāramukhaṃ
kuśalābhisaṃskaraṇamukhaṃ ca), the gate of no birth and the gate of demonstrating
birth (anutpādamukham utpādasaṃdarśanamukhaṃ ca), the gate of no activity and the
gate of parts of the personality, spheres and fields of senseperception (apravṛttimukhaṃ
skandhadhātvāyatanamukhaṃ ca), the gate of no origination and destruction and the gate of
birth and activity (anutpādānirodhamukhaṃ utpādapravṛttimukhaṃ ca), the gate of isolation
and the gate of maturing beings (vivekamukhaṃ satvaparipācanāmukhaṃ ca), the gate of total
reality and the gate of caring for every single thing (dharmadhātumukhaṃ sarvadharmapratirakṣaṇamukhaṃ
ca), the gate of the way of disciplines and the gate of the determination
of the bodhisatva (śrāvakayānamukhaṃ bodhisatvādhyāśayamukhaṃ ca), the gate of isolated awakening
and the gate of never forgetting the qualities of the Buddha (pratyekabodhimukhaṃ
buddhadharmāsaṃpramoṣamukhaṃ ca).Sister, the bodhisatva demonstrating the dual gates but not
getting attached to any gates is called able in expedient means (yo bhagini bodhisatvo
mukhadvayam upadarśayann api sarvamukheṣv asaktaḥ sa upāyakuśala ucyate).In the same way with
the gate of desire and the gate of absence of desire (evam eva rāgamukhaṃ vigatarāgamukhaṃ
ca), the gate of aversion and the gate of absence of aversion (dveṣamukhaṃ vigatadveṣamukhaṃ
ca), the gate of bewilderment and the gate of absence of bewilderment (mohamukhaṃ
vigatamohamukhaṃ ca), the gate of vices and the gate of absence of vices (kleśamukhaṃ vigatakleśamukhaṃ
ca), the gate of all movement and the gate of absence of movement (sarvagatimukham
agatimukhaṃ ca), this, sister is the bodhisatvas ability in expedient means (idaṃ bhagini
bodhisatvasyopāyākauśalyam).The gate of the behaviour of the ordinary naive beings
and the gate of the behaviour of the one to be trained, the one without need of further training,
the disciple, the isolated buddhas as well as that of the bodhisatva, the knowledge
of these two gates is the ability in expedient means of the bodhisatva (yad bālapṛthagjanacaryāmukhaṃ
śaikṣāśaikṣaśrāvakapratyekabuddhabodhisatvacaryāmukhaṃ ca yad taddvayajñānam
idam bodhisatvasyopāyakauśalyam ucyate).
