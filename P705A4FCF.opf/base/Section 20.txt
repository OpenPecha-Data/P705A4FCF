The Lord said: Ānanda, do you see this daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī?Ānanda
said: Yes, Lord, I see her, I see her, Sugata.The Lord said: Ānanda, before this the princely
Mañjuśrī inspired this daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī to completely grasp
the incomparable complete awakening (iyam ānanda suvarṇottaraprabhāśrī gaṇikāduhitā pūrvaṃ
mañjuśriyā kumārabhūtenānuttarāṃ samyaksaṃbodhiṃ samādāpayitum avatāritā), and she, having
heard about religion from him, produced the kind of tolerance which is in accordance
with all things (asyās dharmaṃ tasmāc chrutvā dharmeṣv anulomikī kṣāntir utpāditā).The Lord
said: Ānanda, do you see this son of a banker Bhayadatta?Ānanda said: Yes, Lord, I see him,
I see him, Sugata.The Lord said: Ānanda, before this I inspired this son of a banker Bhayadatta
to completely grasp the incomparable complete awakening (ayam ānanda bhayadattaḥ
śreṣṭhiputraḥ pūrvaṃ mayā samyaksaṃbodhiṃ samādāpayitum avatāritaḥ), and he, having heard
about religion from me, produced the kind of tolerance which is in accordance with all things
(asya dharmaṃ mac chrutvā dharmeṣv anulomikī kṣāntir utpāditā).Ānanda, in a world age
ninety-two times hundred thousand world ages from now called Ratnasaṃbhava, this daughter
of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī will reach complete awakening in a world sphere called
Ratna, and will be tathāgata, an arhat, a fully awakened one called Ratnaprabha. And, Ānanda,
the enjoyment and delight of the beings in that world sphere will be like that of the
class of thirty three gods. There will be no other jewels there but the bodhisatva-jewels,
and the life of that tathāgata will be immeasurable.And during the life of this completely
awakened this son of a banker Bhayadatta will be born as a bodhisatva called Guṇaratnaprabha,
and he will do the work of keeping the religious collection of the tathāgata.At the
time when the tathāgata Ratnaprabha reaches the final extinction he will pronounce the
following prophecy for that bodhisatva Guṇaprabha: This bodhisatva Guṇaprabha will reach the
complete awakening after me, and will be tathāgata, an arhat, a fully awakened one called
Ratnārcis. The display of his buddha-field will be about like mine.As soon as the prophecy
had been spoken for the two of them, for the courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī and for the
son of a banker Bhayadatta, at that opportunity this world system of three thousandfold
worlds was shaken in its six forms of existence, and the worlds were radiated by a grand
lustre. And as that prophecy was set forth, a hundred thousand beings produced the thought
that they would reach the incomparable complete awakening.
