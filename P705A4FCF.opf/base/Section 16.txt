My boy, do you see this perished body of that girl (tvaṃ dāraka tāṃ dārikāyāḥ kāyaṃ paśyasi)?
The boy said: Lord, I see it (paśyāmi bhagavan).The Lord said: My boy, all composite things
are like that impermanent, filled with suffering and selfless (sarve saṃskṛtā anityā duḥkhitāḥ),
they are always changing and unstable (vipariṇāmadharmiṇaś capalāḥ), without eternity
(aśāśvatāḥ), deceiving foolish people (bālollopanāḥ), arising from falseness (mithyābūtāḥ),
without activity (nirīhakāḥ) and illusory established (viṭhapitāḥ).They are like
an illusion because manifested from nothing (māyāsadṛśā abhāvapratibhāsatvāt), they are like
a dream because of being a limited kind of enjoyment (svapnasadṛśā alpāsvādanatvāt), they
are like a mirage because manifesting from bewilderment (marīcisadṛśā bhrāntipratibhāsatvāt),
they are like a reflection because (pratibhāsasadṛśā ādyanutpannatvāt), they are like
an image in a mirror because of the fact that they do not perish as a consequence of the
ripening of actions (pratibimbasadṛśāḥ karmavipākāvipraṇāśayogatvāt), they are like the
reflection of a moon in the water because of the fact that they do not change (udakacandrasadṛśā
acyutayogatvāt), they are like an echo because sound is produced from the soundless
(pratiśrutkāsadṛśā aśabdaśabdapratipādanatvāt), they are like shadow form because they are
the gate of non-production (chāyārūpasadṛśā anabhisaṃskāramukhatvāt), they are like an empty
fist because of being empty of essential nature (riktamuṣṭisadṛśāḥ svabhāvavaśikatvāt).They
cannot be held on to like the wind (agrāhyā vāyusadṛśāḥ), false, without support, in
vain, they do not diminish or increase (mṛṣānālayatucchāhānāpūrṇāḥ).In this way, my boy,
all moments of existence are without a controlling self, and you should not be attached to
them (evaṃ dārika sarvadharmā asvāmikāḥ, na teṣu tvayābhiniveśaṃ kartavyam).And, my boy,
what do you think, how do you look upon your thoughts and reflections connected to your desire
(tat kiṃ manyase dārika ye rāgasaṃyuktavitarkavicārāḥ kathaṃ tān paśyasi)?The boy said:
The desire of the childish ordinary people arise from imagining a beatiful compelexion
and bodily form (bālapṛthagjanānāṃ rāgo bhagavan śubhavarṇsaṃsthānaparikalpād utpadyate),
and it does not arise when there is contemplation of the impure and so on as found in the
discipline of the noble religion (sa āryadharmavinaye ’sucyādipratyavekṣaṇatayā na bhavati).
Lord, if one does not produce thought-constructions of it, the origin of desire does not
originate (yadi bhagavan tatra na kalpate na rāgasamudayaḥ samudiyāt).
