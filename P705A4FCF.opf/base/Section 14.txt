Then that son of a banker, having heard those verses, felt happy and rejoiced, and having got
rid of his fear, he felt joy, was overjoyed, and, disposing of the rotting corpse (mṛtakuṇapa),
he left the park.Then the Lord emitted a ray from his body with the intention of educating
that son of a banker, and the whole land of Magadha was filled with that light.The
boy saw from a distance the True being, the Saint, the Complete Awakened, looking like the
orb of the arising sun, burning with heat and beauty, bringing glory and happiness, with
the senses calmed (praśāntendriya), with the mind calmed, well trained, incomparable, having
obtained the highest truth, shining like a sacrificial post of gold (suvarṇayūpa), with
his senses guarded and controlled like those of an elephant, clear and shining, not turbid
like the sea, adorned with the thirty two characteristics of a great man, surrounded by
his disciples teaching religion.The way where he was walking was variegated and beautiful
to behold, and a railing of gems was set up and flowers were scattered all about.
