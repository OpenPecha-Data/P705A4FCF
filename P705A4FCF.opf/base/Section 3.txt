III. Mañjuśrī said: – Sister, this is the religious teaching of the present true being worthy
of offerings, the perfectly awakened one named Śākyamuni (iyaṃ bhagini tasya śākyamuner
nāma sthitasya tathāgatasyārhataḥ samyaksaṃbuddhasya dharmadeśanā):“As the body partakes in
universal sameness, awakening also partakes in universal sameness; as awakening partakes
in universal sameness, the body also partakes in universal sameness” (kāyasamatayā bodhisamatā,
bodhisamatayā kāyasamatā),that is why I tell you, sister: “You are the awakening yourself
(tvam eva bodhir iti)”.But what is your opinion, sister, this body of yours, is it
made up of parts of the personality, of spheres and fields of perception (tat kiṃ manyase
bhaginy ayaṃ tvatkāyaḥ skandhadhātvāyatanābhinirvṛtto bhavati)?As the girl had heard this
teaching the light of religion was born in her (dharmālokajātā) as the outcome of earlier
roots of good (pūrvakuśalamūlaniṣyanda), and having attained that light, she told Mañjuśrī:–
That is the way it is, Mañjuśrī, this body of mine is made up of parts of the personality,
of spheres and fields of perception (evam etan mañjuśrīr ayaṃ matkāyaḥ skandhadhātvāyatanābhinirvṛtto
bhavati).

Mañjuśrī said: – But, sister, what is your opinion, is there mental activity or consciousness
in form (tat kiṃ manyase bhagini rūpe cetanā vā vijñānaṃ vā bhavati)?The girl said: – Not
at all, Mañjuśrī (no hīdaṃ mañjuśrīḥ).Mañjuśrī said: – Also the awakening, sister, is without
mental activity (acetanā?) and without consciousness (nirvijñāna?).Thus, sister, as
form partakes in universal sameness, awakening also partakes in universal sameness; as awakening
partakes in universal sameness, form also partakes in universal sameness” (rūpasamatayā
bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā rūpasamatā);sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening
yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

But sister, what is your opinion, is there mental activity or consciousness in feelings, perception,
conditioning forces and in consciousness (tat kiṃ manyase bhagini vedanāyāṃ ca saṃjñāyāṃ
ca saṃskāre ca vijñāne ca cetanā vā vijñānaṃ vā bhavati)?The girl said: – Not at all,
Mañjuśrī (no hīdaṃ mañjuśrīḥ).Mañjuśrī said: – Also the awakening, sister, is without
mental activity (acetanā?) and without consciousness (nirvijñāna?).Thus, sister, as consciousness
partakes in universal sameness, awakening also partakes in universal sameness; as
awakening partakes in universal sameness, consciousness also partakes in universal sameness
(vijñānasamatayā bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā vijñānasamatā);sister, that is why I tell you:
“You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

[Then follows the same argument connected to a list of abhidharma-concepts as found in most
mahāyānasūtras: Form (rupa) is not something within (adhyātma), nor something on the outside
(bahirdhā), nor neither (nobhaya), it is not possible to demonstrate the existence of forms
in any place (viṣaya) or any direction (diś) as having a colour etc.; this is also the
case with bodhi, and the two are thus identical. The same goes for the four remaining skandhas,
and, quote, “Sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself“.”]

Further, sister, the five parts of the personality are like a magical creation, they originate
from nothing, from misunderstanding, nothing but an unexistent and misleading conventional
expression (punar aparaṃ bhagini pañcaskandhā māyopamā asadviparyāsotpannā asadviparyāsavyavahārāḥ);
and also the awakening is like a magical creation, nothing but an unexistent
and misleading conventional expression (bodhir api bhagini māyopamāsadviparyāsavyavahārā).Thus,
sister, as a magical creation partakes in universal sameness, the parts of personality
partakes in universal sameness; as the parts of personality partakes in universal sameness,
a magical creation partakes in universal sameness (māyāsamatayā skandhasamatā, skandhasamatayā
māyāsamatā); as a magical creation partakes in universal sameness, awakening partakes
in universal sameness; as awakening partakes in universal sameness, a magical creation
partakes in universal sameness (māyāsamatayā bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā māyāsamatā);sister,
that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

[Same conclusion (tvam eva bodhir iti) on the basis of the following arguments concerned with
some of the other similes for demonstrating the irreality of the skandhas: The parts of
the personality (skandha) are like a dream (svapnopama), not at all brought into being (atyantānabhinirvṛtta),
awakening is also not brought into being as having the same nature as
a dream (svapnasvabhāva); the skandhas are like mirage (marīcyupama) arisen through bewildered
action (bhrāntakarma) (as when lost in the desert?), and awakening also has the essence
of a mirage (marīcisvabhāva) since beyond the maturation (vipāka) of action; the skandhas
are like a reflection in a mirror (pratibimbopama), not disappearing (acyuta) (as long
as the image mirrored is there?), thus also bodhi, which has the essence of a reflection
(pratibimbasvabhāva). (Tib. p. 530-66, Dh p. 818a9-17, Na p. 826b10-20)]

Further, sister, the parts of personality (skandha) are only a word (nāmamātra), and that word
is neutral (aniñja); and sister, the awakening (bodhi) is also a word (nāmamātra), and
that word is neutral (aniñja).Thus, sister, as the neutral partakes in universal sameness,
the parts of personality partakes in universal sameness; as the parts of personality partakes
in universal sameness, the neutral partakes in universal sameness (aniñjasamatayā skandhasamatā,
skandhasamatayā aniñjasamatā); as the neutral partakes in universal sameness,
awakening partakes in universal sameness; as awakening partakes in universal sameness, the
neutral partakes in universal sameness (aniñjasamatayā bodhisamatā, bodhisamatayā aniñjasamatā);sister,
that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

Further, sister, among the parts of personality there is no acting subject, and the meaning
of being unmade is awakening (punar aparaṃ bhagini na skandheṣu kārakaḥ, akṛtakārthas tu bodhiḥ);
among the parts of personality there is no proper nature and the meaning of being
without a proper nature is awakening (na skandheṣu svabhāvaḥ, niḥsvabhāvārthas tu bodhiḥ);
among the parts of personality there is no origination, and the meaning of being non-originated
is awakening (na skandheṣūtpādaḥ, anutpannārthas tu bodhiḥ), among the parts of personality
there is no permanence, and the meaning of being without permanence is awakening
(na skandheṣu nityatā, anityārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is no
happiness, and the meaning of suffering is awakening (na skandheṣu sukham, duḥkhārthas tu
bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is nothing pure, and the meaning of impurity
is awakening (na skandheṣu śubham, aśubhārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality
there is no self, and the meaning of selflessness is awakening (na skandheṣv ātmā, anātmārthas
tu bodhiḥ).Further, sister, among the parts of personality there is no development,
and the meaning of being being beyond development is awakening (punar aparaṃ, bhagini, na
skandheṣv abhinirvṛttiḥ, anabhinirvṛttārthas tu bodhiḥ); the parts of personality are something
apart, and the meaning of being something apart is awakening (skandhā viviktāḥ, viviktārthas
tu bodhiḥ); among the parts of personality there is nothing to grasp, and the meaning
of being beyond grasping is awakening (na skandheṣa grāhyaḥ, agrāhyārthas tu bodhiḥ);
(Na 826c) among the parts of personality there is no support, and the meaning of being without
support is awakening (na skandheṣv āśrayaḥ, anāśrayārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts
of personality there is no going or coming, and the meaning of being beyond coming and going
is awakening (na skandheṣv āgamanirgamau, anāgamanirgamārthas tu bodhiḥ); among the parts
of personality there is nothing remaining in the present, and the meaning of not remaining
in the present is awakening (na skandheṣu pratyutpannasthitiḥ, apratyutpannasthityarthas
tu bodhiḥ).Further, sister, the parts of the personality (skandha) are only a holy conventional
expression (āryavyavahāra), and also the awakening (bodhi) is a holy conventional
expression (āryavyavahāra); the parts of personality are essentially beyond conventional
expressions, and the awakening is beyond conventional expressions (skandhā vyavahārasvabhāvāḥ,
bodhir apy avyavahārā); what is the essential nature of the five parts of personality,
that is the essential nature of the all the moments of existence penetrated by the True
Being, and that is awakening (yatsvabhāvāś ca pañcaskandhās tatsvabhāvāḥ sarvatathāgatādhigatadharmāḥ
sā bodhir iti). In this way, sister, the essential nature of the parts of the
personality (Dh 818b) is the essential nature of awakening, (evam eva bhagini skandhasvabhāvo
bodhisvabhāvaḥ), and the essential nature of awakening is the essential nature of all
moments of existence (bodhisvabhāvaḥ sarvadharmasvabhāvaḥ), sister, what is the essential
nature of the five parts of personality, what is the essential nature of awakening, that
is the essential nature of all beings (yatsvabhāvaḥ pañcaskandhā yatsvabhāvā ca bodhis tatsvabhāvāḥ
sarvasatvāḥ), and, sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself
(tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

Further, sister, what is understanding the parts of the personality, that, certainly, is awakening
(punar aparaṃ bhagini yaḥ skandhāvabodhaḥ saiva bodhiḥ), there is no [real] understanding
not including the parts of the personality, there is no [real] understanding not including
the awakening (na skandhāparyāpanno ’vabodho na ca bodhyaparyāpanno ’vabodhaḥ), thus
what is understanding is awakening (evam eva yo ’vabodhaḥ sā bodhiḥ); sister, that is why
I tell you: "You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)". Sister, you should
know things according to this teaching (paryāya): As all beings are included in the awakening
(sarvasattvā bodhiparyāpannāḥ), that teaching not included anywhere (aparyāpannopadeśa)
is the awakening (bodhi), sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself
(tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

Further, sister, in this body of yours the four elements are produced (abhinirvṛtta), namely,
the element of earth (pṛthivīdhātu), the element of water (abdhātu), the element of fire
(tejodhātu) and the element of wind (vāyudhātu), and sister, the element of earth is not
the self, not the being itself, not then life-principle, not the spirit, not the reincarnating
individual (pṛthivīdhātus tu nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalaḥ), and also
the awakening is not the self, not the being itself, not then life-principle, not the spirit,
not the reincarnating individual (bodhir api nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalaḥ).
Thus also the element of water, the element of fire and the element of wind are not
the self, not the being itself, not then life-principle, not the spirit, not the reincarnating
individual (evam abdhātus tejodhātur vāyudhātur nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalaḥ),
and also the awakening is not the self, not the being itself, not then life-principle,
not the spirit, not the reincarnating individual (bodhir api nātmā na satvo na jīvo
na puruṣo na pudgalaḥ). The element of earth and the awakening are the same because of their
absolute sameness to empty space (pṛthivīdhātur bodhiś ca samā atyantākāśasamatvāt); the
element of water and the awakening are the same because of their absolute non-existence
(abdhātur bodhiś ca samā atyantābhāvatvāt); the element of fire and the awakening are the
same because of their absolute neutrality (tejodhātur bodhiś ca samā atyantāniñjyatvāt);
the element of wind and the awakening are the same because of being absolutely beyond demonstration
(vāyudhātur bodhiś ca samā atyantānidarśanatvāt). What is the element of earth,
sister, that element is known and understood by The True Being (yo pṛthivīdhātur bhagini so
dhātus tathāgatena jñāto ’bhisamāgataḥ); what is the element of water, sister, that element
is known and understood by The True Being (yo ’bdhātur bhagini so dhātus tathāgatena jñāto
’bhisamāgataḥ); what is the element of fire, sister, that element is known and understood
by The True Being (yas tejodhātur bhagini so dhātus tathāgatena jñāto ’bhisamāgataḥ);
what is the element of wind, sister, that element is known and understood by The True Being
(yo vāyudhātur bhagini so dhātus tathāgatena jñāto ’bhisamāgataḥ); and sister, understanding
the element of earth is awakening (pṛthivīdhātvavabodho bodhiḥ), thus, sister, understanding
the element of water, the element of fire and the element of wind is awakening (evaṃ
bhaginy abdhātutejodhātuvāyudhātvavabodho bodhiḥ); sister, that is why I tell you: "You
are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)". Sister, the element of earth does not
know the element of water (pṛthivīhātur bhagini nābdhātuṃ saṃjānāti); the element of water
does not know the element of fire (abdhātur na tejodhātuṃ saṃjānāti); the element of fire
does not know the element of wind (tejodhātur na vāyudhātuṃ saṃjānāti); in that way, sister,
thorough knowledge of the word element is called awakening (tathā bhagini yā dhātunām
aparijñā sā bodhir iti); sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself
(tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

Further, sister, in this body of yours the eye (cakṣus) is produced (abhinirvṛtta), and in the
same way, the ear (śrotra), nose (ghrāṇa), body (kāya), tongue (jihvā) and mind (manas)
are produced (abhinirvṛtta); but sister, the eye is empty (cakṣur bhagini śūnyam), and the
essential nature of the eye, being emptiness, is awakening (cakṣuḥśūnyatāsvabhāvo bodhiḥ);
[same for the remaining senses, with the conclusion “You are the awakening yourself”].

Further, sister, the emptiness of the eye does not communicate [constructed concepts of] form
(punar aparaṃ bhagini yā cakṣuḥśūnyatā na sā rūpaṃ prajñāpayati), and the essential nature
of empty form is awakening (śūnyasya rūpasya svabhāvo bodhiḥ); [same for the remaining
senses, with the conclusion "You are the awakening yourself"]. Sister, thus the eye does not
grasp form, as also the awakening does not grasp form (na tu cakṣū rūpaṃ gṛhṇāti na bodhir
api rūpaṃ gṛhṇāti); [same for the remaining senses]. And what, sister, is the reason for
this (tad bhagini kasya hetoḥ)? The eye not connected to a form is awakening, and, similarly
with the other senses, the mind not connected to a moment of existence is awakening
(cakṣū rūpāpagataṃ bodhir yāvan mano dharmāpagataṃ bodhiḥ). Thus, sister, the sphere of eye-consciousness
is something not connected to the sphere of form, and the sphere of eye-consciousness
not connected to a form is awakening (evaṃ bhagini yaś cakṣurvijñānadhātuḥ so
rūpadhātvapratisandhikaḥ, cakṣurvijñānadhātū rūpadhātvapagato bodhiḥ). [Same for the remaining
senses, with the conclusion "You are the awakening yourself"]. Thus, sister, the awakening
and sphere of eye-consciousness are beyond duality and not distinguishable as two entities
(evaṃ bhagini bodhiś cakṣurvijñānadhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ), the awakening
and sphere of form are beyond duality and not distinguishable as two entities (bodhiḥ rūpadhātuś
ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ); as the awakening and sphere of mind are beyond duality
and not distinguishable as two entities (yāvad bodhir manodhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ),
the awakening and sphere of moments of existrence are beyond duality and not distinguishable
as two entities (bodhir dharmadhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ); the awakening
and sphere of mind-consciousness are beyond duality and not distinguishable as two entities
(bodhir manovijñānadhātuś ca te ’dvayā dvayāprabhedāḥ); sister, that is why I tell you:
“You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

Further, sister, understanding the eye is awakening, and, similarly, understanding hearing,
smelling, tasting, body and mind is awakening (punar aparaṃ bhagini cakṣuravabodho bodhir
evaṃ śrotraghrāṇajihvākāyamano’vabodho bodhiḥ); the essential nature of the eye is empty,
and this empty essential nature is awakening, and, similarly, the essential nature of hearing,
smelling, tasting, body and mind is empty, and this empty essential nature is awakening
(cakṣuḥsvabhāvaḥ śūnyaḥ sa śūnyasvabhāvo bodhir evaṃ śrotraghrāṇajihvākāyamanaḥsvabhāvaḥ
śūnyaḥ sa śūnyasvabhāvo bodhiḥ).Sister, the essential nature of the eye is beyond desire,
aversion and bewilderment, and what is without desire, aversion and bewilderment is awakening
(cakṣuḥsvabhāvo bhaginy araktādviṣṭāmūḍhaḥ, rāgadveṣamohāpagatā tu bodhiḥ); the essential
nature of the hearing, smelling, tasting, body and mind is beyond desire, aversion and
bewilderment, and what is without desire, aversion and bewilderment is awakening (śrotraghrāṇajihvākāyamanaḥsvabhāvo
’raktādviṣṭāmūḍhaḥ, rāgadveṣamohāpagatā tu bodhiḥ).Sister, the
eye is without owner, owned or the act of owning, the awakening is also owner, owned or
tha act of owning (cakṣur bhaginy asvāmikam amamam aparigrahakam, bodhir api asvāmikāmamāparigrahikā);
[same for the other senses].Sister, the eye is not connected to the condition
of being a man, it is not connected to the condition of a being a woman (cakṣur bhagini
na puruṣadharmasamprayuktaṃ nāpi strīdharmasamprayuktam); and, sister, awakening is not connected
to the condition of being a man, it is not connected to the condition of a being a
woman (bodhir bhagini na puruṣadharmasamprayuktaṃ nāpi strīdharmasamprayuktam). [Same for
the other senses.] Sister, the eye is not a man, it is not a woman (cakṣur bhagini na puruṣo
nāpi strī), and, sister, awakening is not a man, it is not a woman (bodhir bhagini na
puruṣo nāpi strī); as, sister, the mind is not a man, it is not a woman (mano bhagini na puruṣo
nāpi strī), and, sister, awakening is not a man, it is not a woman (bodhir bhagini na
puruṣo nāpi strī). Sister, thus the Real Being understands the reality of the eye, and this
understanding is awakening (tathā bhagini cakṣustathatā tathāgatenādhigatā, tathatāvabodhas
tu bodhiḥ), as the Real Being understands the reality of the mind, and this understanding
is awakening (yāvan manastathatā tathāgatenādhigatā, tathatāvabodhas tu bodhiḥ). Sister,
that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

Further, sister, this body of yours is not a self, not an animated being, not a life-principle,
not a spirit, not a personality, not a human, not a man, not a creator, not a subject
of feeling, knowing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, not a subject of consciousness
(punar aparaṃ bhagini tvatkāyo ’yaṃ nātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalo na manujo
na mānavo na kārako na vedako na jñātā na draṣṭā na śrotā na ghrātā na bhoktā na spraṣṭā na
vijñātā); sister, also awakening is not a self, not an animated being, not a life-principle,
not a spirit, not a personality, not a human, not a man, not a creator, not a subject
of feeling, knowing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, not a subject of consciousness
(nāpi bodhir ātmā na satvo na jīvo na puruṣo na pudgalo na manujo na mānavo na kārako na
vedako na jñātā na draṣṭā na śrotā na ghrātā na bhoktā na spraṣṭā na vijñātā). Thus, sister,
the universal sameness of all moments of existence is awakening (evaṃ bhagini sarvadharmasamatā
bodhiḥ).Sister, this body of yours is neutral, without an acting subject and impermanent,
it is not distinct and different from grass, wood, trees and building material of
stone (yo bhagini tvatkāyo ’niñjyo ’kārako ’nityaḥ, tṛṇakāṣṭavṛkṣabhittigaṇāviśiṣṭāprabhinnaḥ).
And, sister, the inner element of earth and the outer element of earth are not two
and not distinguishable as two entities (yo bhaginy adhyātmapṛthivīdhātur bāhyapṛthivīdhātuś
cādvayau dvayāprabhedau), and as such they have the one characteristic of being without
characteristics (evam alakṣaṇāv ekalakṣaṇau) when understood by the Tathāgata through his
insight and knowledge (prajñājñāna). Sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening
yourself (tvam eva bodhir iti)”.

Further, sister, the experience in thoughts, mind and consciousness by which exist intention,
the thoughts of consciousness and the experince in thought and consciousness, does not abide
in the hair, not in the hair on the body, not in the cuticle, not in the skin, not in
the flesh, not in the blood, not in the bones, not in the sinews, not in the marrow, not
inside, not outside, not in neither of them, not in the eye, not in the ear, not in the nose,
not in the tongue, not in the bod, not in the mind, does not abide, does not not abide,
it is not discontinuity, does not abide in an area, not in any direction (punar aparaṃ bhagini
yayā cittamanovijñānavijñaptyā cetanā vijñānacittam manovijñānavijñaptiḥ sā na keśe
tiṣṭhati, na rome tiṣṭhati, na chavau tiṣṭhati, na tvaci tiṣṭhati, na māṃse tiṣṭhati, na
rudhire tiṣṭhati, na asthau tiṣṭhati, na naharau(?Mvy) tiṣṭhati, na majjāyāṃ tiṣṭhati, nādhyātme
tiṣṭhati, na bāhye tiṣṭhati, na nobhaye tiṣṭhati, na cakṣuṣi tiṣṭhati, na śrotre tiṣṭhati,
na ghrāṇe tiṣṭhati, na jihvāyāṃ tiṣṭhati, na kāye tiṣṭhati, na manasi tiṣṭhati, na
na tiṣṭhati, nāvacchedaḥ, na gocare tiṣṭhati, na deśe tiṣṭhati), it is without form, not
possible to demonstrate, beyond experience, ungraspable, unmixed, without basis, pure, clean
and brilliant (arūpiny anirdeśyāvijñaptir agrahyā niḥsaṃsargānāśrayā śuddhā śuciḥ prabhāsvarā);
that experience in thoughts and mind is beyond the impurity of vices and also beyond
purity (sā cittamanovijñaptir asaṃkliṣṭānavadātā), it is since it is without body in being
essentially pure and brilliant that it beyond the impurity of vices and also beyond purity
(sā svabhāvena viśuddhaprabhāsvare ’śarīratvād asaṃkliṣṭānavadātā).

Thus, sister, the essential nature of the parts of the personality, the spheres and the fields
of perception is the awakening, and the essential nature of awakening is the parts of the
personality, the spheres and the fields of perception (evaṃ bhagini skandhadhātvāyatanasvabhāvas
tu bodhiḥ, bodhisvabhāvo ’pi skandhadhātvāyatanāni). And, sister, the parts of the
personality, the spheres and the fields of perception as developed in your body is the
awakening, the awakening is nothing else (asmin bhagini tvatkāye yāni skandhadhātvāyatanāny
abhinirvṛttāni sā bodhir, nānyā bodhiḥ). Why? Awakening is nothing else than the parts of
the personality, the spheres and the fields of perception, these, indeed, are awakening
– since understanding the sameness of all moments of existence is awakening (tat kasya hetor,
bodhir na skandhadhātvāyatanabhyo ’nyā, tāny eva bodhiḥ, sarvadharmasamatāvabodhas tu
bodhiḥ). Sister, that is why I tell you: “You are the awakening yourself (tvam eva bodhir
iti)”.

As the princely Mañjuśrī had taught this teaching, five hundred sons of gods in the firmament
produced the thought of the incomparable perfect awakening; among the men, women, boys and
girls in the entourage of Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī two hundred beings produced the thought
of the incomparable perfect awakening; and sixty gods and men attained the stainless, impeccable
and pure sight of religion.
