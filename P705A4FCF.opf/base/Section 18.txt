Then the princely Mañjuśrī addressed himself to the son of a banker Bhayadatta, saying: My boy,
do you know this sister?The boy said: Yes, I do.Mañjuśrī said: How do you know her?Then
the boy spoke these verses to the princely Mañjuśrī:

1) Beautiful forms (rūpa) are just like a heap of foam (phenapiṇḍa), feelings (vedanā) are just
like bubbels (budbuda), concepts (saṃjñā) are like a mirage (marīci), the formative principles
(saṃskāra) are like the soft plantaintree (kadalī),2) and consciousness (vijñāna)
is just like an illusion (māyā); they are all born from fantasies (parikalpāt), and I know
her as an inexistent thought-construction (abhūtakalpita) of a child.3) The body itself
is inactive (aniñja), it is dead matter (mūrkha), like grass and stones (tṛṇakudya); consciousness
(vijñāna) is impossible to display (anidarśana); this is the way I know her.4) In
it is no being (satva), no self (ātman), no life principle (jīva), no person (pudgala), this
body is just a heap; this is the way I know her.5) In it is no desire (rāga), aversion
(dveṣa) or bewilderment (moha), no vice (kleśa) and no purification (viśuddhi); this is the
way I know her.6) In superficial (ayoniśaḥ) teachings there is childish confusion (bhrānti),
to this the wise are not attached (asakta); this is the way I know her.7) Just like
an ill-smelling corpse lying in the jungle, this form has a similar nature (svabhāva); this
is the way I know her.8) It is unborn in the beginning (pūrvāntānutpanna), not perishing
in the end (aparāntācyuta) and inexistent in the present (pratyutpannābhūta); this is the
way I know her.9) After having been stupified (saṃmūrcchita) by it I have been liberated
by the impure (aśubha), so, Mañjughoṣa, what this is about, I am not really able to answer.10)
Though there is really no death (maraṇa), really no transmigration (cyuti), I am still
manifesting that I am dying for the sake of maturing living beings (satvaparipācanāya),
so that no one will not seek awakening (bodhi).11) As my desire (rāga) and aversion (dveṣa)
and all my vices (kleśa) are something superficial (ayoniśas), such is also the character
(lakṣaṇa) of all beings, this is the reality of all things (iyaṃ dharmāṇāṃ dharmatā).
