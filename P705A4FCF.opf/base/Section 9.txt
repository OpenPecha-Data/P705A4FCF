Then the princely Mañjuśrī said to the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī: Girl,
get on to the cart and, out of compassion, bring the son of a banker Bhayadatta to maturation,
by this you will embrace the ascetic life and be ordained (atha mañjuśrīḥ kumārabhūtaḥ
suvarṇottaraprabhāśriyaṃ gaṇikāduhitāram idam avocat, tvaṃ dārike ’smin ratha āruḍhā śreṣṭhiputraṃ
bhayadattam anukampām ādāya paripācaya, tenaiva tvaṃ pravrājitopasaṃpannā bhaviṣyasi).Then
the great crowd of people thought: How can it be right that one without desire
can stay in the company of one who is not without desire (atha tasya mahato janakāyasyaivam
abhavad vītarāgāvitarāgayoḥ sārdhasaṃvāsaḥ kathaṃ yujyata iti)?The girl knew the reflections
of the great crowd of people, and she said (atha sā dārikā tasya mahato janakāyasya
cetaḥparivitarkaṃ cetasājñāya taṃ mahāntaṃ janakāyam idam avocat):Even though, friends, the
bodhisatva without desires stays in the company of beings full of desire, he is without
blemish, he educates the beings full of desires (vītarāgo mārṣā bodhisatvaḥ sarāgaiḥ satvaiḥ
sārdhaṃ saṃvasann apy anavadyaḥ sarāgān satvān vinayati);even though, friends, the bodhisatva
without aversion stays in the company of beings full of aversion, he is without blemish,
he educates the beings full of aversion (vītadoṣo mārṣā bodhisatvaḥ sadoṣaiḥ satvaiḥ
sārdhaṃ saṃvasann apy anavadyaḥ sadoṣān satvān vinayati);even though, friends, the bodhisatva
without bewilderment stays in the company of beings full of bewilderment, he is without
blemish, he educates the beings full of bewilderment (vītamoho mārṣā bodhisatvaḥ samohaiḥ
satvaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasann apy anavadyaḥ samohān satvān vinayati);even though, friends,
the bodhisatva without vices stays in the company of beings full of vices, he is without blemish,
he educates the beings full of vices (niṣkleśo mārṣā bodhisatvaḥ sakleśaiḥ satvaiḥ
sārdhaṃ saṃvasann apy anavadyaḥ sakleśān satvān vinayati).Just like, friends, a mother is
not desirous of his son, just in the same way, friends, is the bodhisatva not desirous of
any living beings (tadyathā mārṣā na mātā putreṇa sārdhaṃ saṃvasaty api raktā, evam eva mārṣā
na bodhisatvaḥ sarvasatvaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasann api raktaḥ);just like, friends, a man closed
up in prison does not act according to habits of desire, just so friends, the bodhisatva
is not attached to concepts in the threefold world which is like a pit in a prison (tadyathā
mārṣā na bandhanagaṭṭito puruṣo rāgasamudācāraṃ carati, evam eva mārṣā na traidhātuke
bandhanakhadopame saṃjñābhiḥ saktaḥ).
