Then The Powerful One, the King of the Gods, having appeared before that boy, addressed himself
to him (śakro devendras tasya dārakasya purataḥ sthitvā taṃ dārakam idam uvāca):Boy, having
seen the Tathāgata, your mind will be at ease, and that is really a great attainment
(tvaṃ dāraka tathāgataṃ dṛṣṭvā prasannacittaḥ sulabdhalābhaḥ).And the Tathāgata thinks of
you, so, boy, do set out on this road and go to the Tathāgata (tathāgatas tvām eva cintayati,
tvam dārakedaṃ pantham avatīrya tathāgatasyāntike gaccha)!Then that boy went with The
Powerful One, the King of the Gods, to the Lord (atha so dārakaḥ śakro devendreṇa sārddham
yena bhagavāṃs tena jagama), and then The Powerful One, the King of the Gods, gave that
boy some māndārava flowers saying: “Boy, you should sprinkle these on the Tathāgata,” and
then that boy sprinkeled those flowers on the Lord.Having done so, he bowed his head the the
feet of the Lord, and circumambulated him three times; then he sat down before the Lord,
and he addressed the Lord with the following words:Lord, I take my refuge in the Lord, His
Religion and His Community, and this root of good of mine I transform into complete awakening
(ahaṃ bhagavantaṃ dharmaṃ ca saṃghaṃ ca śaraṇaṃ gacchāmi, idaṃ ca mama kuśalamūlam
anuttarāyai samyaksaṃbodhaye pariṇāmiyiṣyāmi).Lord, I led this famously beautiful girl, approached
even by kings, called Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī to the park to have fun and pleasure
with her, but suddenly she lost all her colour and her body started to rot (mayā bhagavan
suvarṇottamaprabhāśrīr iti janapadakalyāṇī rājādhigatā ratikrīḍāyodyānam ānītā bhagavan sā
varṇāpagatā kāyaṃ ca pūtibhūtā).Since all my companions (sarvajñātigaṇa) have left me, I
have become very scared (mahābhayajāta), but, Lord, the king is not going to execute me as
punishment for this?The Lord said: My boy, do not doubt, in those who have taken their refuge
in the Buddha fear does not arise again, so since I have invited you here through absence
of fear, do not produce fear!But still, the cause from which fear and terror arise should
be given up (kiṃ tarhi dāraka yena nidānena trāsabhayam utpadyate tan nidānaṃ parijahāhi)!The
boy said: Lord, what is the cause of fear and terror (kiṃ bhagavaṃs trāsabhayanidānam)?The
Lord said: Desire, my boy, aversion and bewilderment are the cause of fear and terror
(rāgo dārika dveṣaś ca mohas trāsabhaynidānam); the haughtiness of thinking “I am” is
the cause (asmimāno nidānam); being obsessed by doctrinal viewpoints is the cause (dṛṣṭiparyutthānaṃ
nidānam); attachment by thirst is the cause (tṛṣṇādhyavasāno nidānam); egotism
and self-related ideas are the cause (ahaṃkāro mamakāraś ca nidānam); attachment to things
is the cause (vastvabhiniveṣo nidānam); possessions and quarrels are the cause (parigrahavigraho
nidānam); the fetters of viewing things as substantially real is the cause (satkāyadīṣṭibandhanaṃ
nidānam); the concept of permanence of the impermanent is the cause (anitye
nityasaṃjñā nidānam); the concept of happiness where there is suffering is the cause (duḥkhe
sukhasaṃjñā nidānam); the concept of beauty where there is ugliness is the cause (aśubhe
śubhasaṃjñā nidānam); the concept of self where there is no self is the cause (anātme
ātmasaṃjñā nidānam); the concept that there is something to hold on to among the parts of
the personality is the cause (skandheṣu parigrahasaṃjñā nidānam); no insight in the spheres
of perception is the cause (dhātuṣv apratyavekṣā nidānam); absence of knowledge of the
fields of perception is the cause (āyataneṣv aparijñānaṃ nidānam); not seeing the defects
of the the body is the cause (kāye ’doṣadarśanatā nidānam); enjoyment of life is the cause
(jīvitābhinandanaṃ nidānam); by these causes fear and terror arise, and so they should be
done away with (tair nidānair dāraka trāsabhayam utpadyate tena tāni prahātavyāni).
