Then the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī went down onto the dharma-stair where
one descends from the cart, stepping down and trodding upon the earth. Freed from the obscuration
of ignorance (avidyāndhakāra) she had fully realized the vision of fear regarding
the vices resulting from the imperfections of existence (bhāvadoṣakleśabhayadarśana), and
having bowed her head to the feet of the princely Mañjuśrī and circumambulated him three
times, she expressed herself by means of verses beside the stairs of the cart:

1) Being essentially pure (svabhāvaśuddhā) I am not impassioned (rāgāraktā), not affected by
aversion (dveṣādviṣṭā) because of constant friendliness (nityamaitricitta), not bewildered
by delusion (mohāsaṃmūḍha) because of the light of insight (prajñāvabhāsa) I will mount
this cart.2) That by means of which I was overpowered before, when, attached to riches(dhanyaraktā),
I went to the park, riding a car with a banker’s son (śreṣṭhiputra) – that thought-construction
of passion (rāgavikalpa), where is it gone?3) Just like when thick clouds
cover the earth, and the rays of sun does not shine, does not burn (sūryaraśmayo na bhāṣante
na tapanti, nevertheless, those rays do not go anywhere, they only cease since they cannot
shine due to the covering of the clouds.4) Just so are all fools (bāla), obscured by
the vices. Even though they have not developed any intelligence (mati) regarding the light
of insight (prajñāvabhāsa), even though they remain outside any area of insight, still, with
the thorough understanding of the vices (kleśaparijñā), insight shines forth.5) Vices
come (kleśa) comes (āgata) from nowhere, they do not depart (gata) to any place (viṣayapradeśabhāga),
vices arise from the superficial (ayoniśas), they do not arise from the fundamental
(yoniśas).6) There is no giving away and no grasping, no arising and no destruction,
there is no giving to others or taking back, and because of the homogeneousness of all moments
of existence (dharmasamatā) I am also pure (viśuddhā).7) When a lamp of sesame oil (tailapradīpa)
appears in the darkness, there is no going of the darkness into different directions,
when darkness is dispelled by insight (prajñā) there is no cessation of vices and
also no origination.8) Just like a doctor who is curing a patient does not destroy the elements
of the [patient’s] body (dhātu), but pacifies the adventitious (āgantuka) disease,
and then other diseases do not arise.9) In the same way the best of physicians Mañjughoṣa,
knowing the appropriate methods (yuktanayajña), pacifies (upaśamayati) the vices of beings
by the different practices, but he does not make the moments of existence disappear.10)
These parts of the personality (skandha), spheres (dhātu) and fields of sense perception
(āyatana) do not change at all (atyantanirvikāra). Earlier they were possessed by the poison
of sin (doṣaviṣa), and still they are unchanged, but rendered free of poison.
