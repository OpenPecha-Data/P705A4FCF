Then the Venerable Ānanda addressed himself to the Lord: Lord, what is the name of this expostion
of religion? How should it be adopted?The Lord said: Ānanda, this is why you should
adopt this exposition of religion as “The chapter on the gate into the great display” (mahāvyūhamukhaparivarta),
you should adopt it as “The miraculous play of Mañjuśrī” (mañjuśrīvikrīḍita),
you should adopt it as “The education of the daugther of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī”
(suvarṇottamaprabhāśrīgaṇikāduhitāvinaya).As the Lord had uttered these words,
the venerable Ānanda, the courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī, the son of a banker Bhayadatta,
the princely Mañjuśrī, those great beings the bodhisatvas and all their retinue, and the
world with gods, men giants celestial musicians were overjoyed and they praised what the
Lord had spoken.
