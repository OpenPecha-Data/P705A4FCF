The Lord said: Very good, very good, my boy, it is like this, not making thought-constructions
or conflicting thought-constructions is the essential nature of desire (sādhu sādhu dārika
tadyathāyam akalpāvikalpo rāgasvabhāvaḥ).So, my boy, you should practice fundamental mental
effort concerning the teachings on the absence of own views, on the absence of others’
views and on the absence of imputing views to others (tvayā dārikānātmadṛṣṭyaparadṛṣṭiparadṛṣṭyasamāropeṣu
dharmeṣu yoniśaś cintāyogaḥ karaṇīyaḥ).The boy said: But, Lord, how does
the bodhisatva become one practicing fundamental mental effort (kathaṃ bhagavan bodhisatvo
yoniśaś cintāyukto bhavet)?The Lord said: My boy, the bodhisatva seeks awakening by means
of the essence of desire (bodhisatvo dāraka rāgasvabhāvena bodhiṃ paryeṣati); my boy,
the bodhisatva seeks awakening by means of the essence of aversion, the essence of bewilderment,
the essence of all the vices (tathā dāraka bodhisatvo dveṣasvabhāvena mohasvabhāvena
ca sarvakleśasvabhāvena ca bodhiṃ paryeṣati).My boy, as desire, aversion and bewilderment
are non-substantial, in accordance with this is the bodhisatva’s entrance into knowledge
(yathā dāraka rāgadveṣamohā avastukās tathā sarvadharmeṣu bodhisatvasya jñānapraveśaḥ).My
boy, desire, aversion and bewilderment are without root, and without an abiding-place, without
foundation, without an acting or feeling subject,beyond the dicotomy of inner and outer,
empty, without self, being, life-principle, life-soul, spirit or personality, without
distinguishing marks, without the construdtion of distinguishing marks, without wishful thinking,
without pleasure, without passion and thirst, without formative factors (rāgadveṣamohā
dārakāmūlakā aniketā anālayā akārakā avedakā adhyātmabāhyaviviktāḥ śūnyā ātmasatvajīvapoṣapuruṣapudgalarahitā
ānimittā nimittakalpanārahitā apraṇidhānā anabhiratayo ratitṛṣṇārahitā
anabhisaṃskārā niḥsvabhāvāḥ).My boy, as desire, aversion and bewilderment are unborn,
in accordance with this is the bodhisatva’s entrance into knowledge (yathā dāraka rāgadveṣamohā
anutpannā tathā sarvadharmeṣu bodhisatvasya jñānapraveśaḥ).Further, my boy, all the
thoughts of the bodhisatva practising in the fundamental way are awakening (punar aparaṃ
dāraka sarve yoniśo yuktasya bodhisatvasya cittotpādā bodhiḥ). Why (tat kasya hetoḥ)?The
understanding of thought is beyond demonstration, beyond wishful thinking, beyond information,
like an illusion, not inside, not outside, nor mutually existing, thus formless, and
that, exactly, my boy, is the awakening of the bodhisatva (yaś cittāvabodhiḥ so ’nidarśano
’praṇihito ’vijñaptir māyasadṛśo nādhyātmo na bāhyo nānyonyabhāvo ’rūpī, sa eva dāraka bodhisatvasya
bodhiḥ).And, my boy, apart from understanding one’s own thoughts there is nothing
else the bodhisatva needs to understand (na dāraka kiṃcid anyad bodhisatvena boddhavyaṃ
svacittāvabodhād), the understanding of one’s own thought is indeed the understanding of
the thought of all beings (yaḥ svacittāvabodhaḥ sa eva sarvasatvānāṃ cittāvabodhaḥ); if
one’s own thoughts are standing aloof, the thoughts of all beings are standing aloof (svacittavivekatayā
sarvasattvānāṃ cittavivekaḥ), by [understanding] the essence of one’s own thoughts
[one understands] the essence of the thoughts of all beings (svacittasvabhāvena sarvasattvānāṃ
cittasvabhāvaḥ), if one’s own thoughts are pure, the thoughts of all beings are
pure (svacittaviśuddhyā sarvasatvānāṃ cittaviśuddhiḥ), if one’s own thoughts are without
desire, the thoughts of all beings are without desire (svacittavirāgena sarvasatvānāṃ cittavirāgaḥ),
if one’s own thoughts are witout aversion, the thoughts of all beings are without
aversion (svacittādveṣena sarvasatvānāṃ cittādveṣaḥ), if one’s own thoughts are without
bewilderment, the thoughts of all beings are without bewilderment (svacittāmohena sarvasatvānāṃ
cittāmohaḥ), if one’s own thoughts are without vices, the thoughts of all beings
are without vices (svacittaniṣkleśena sarvasatvānāṃ cittaniṣkleśaḥ), such understanding is
the understanding of omniscience (ya evamavabodhodaḥ sa sarvajñajñānāvabodhaḥ).Thus the bodhisatva
practicing fundamentally, my boy, has the insight that the thoughts of all beings
are essentially without vices (evam yoniśaḥprayukto bodhisatvo dāraka sarvasatvānāṃ cittāni
svabhāvena niṣkleśāni prajānati).Those who are not stained by vices in their train of
thoughts even thought they are occasionally sullied by adventitious vices, in them there is
also no fervent desire because of their expanded vision which is in accordance with the
true religion (ya āgantukaiḥ kleśair upakliṣṭā api na cittasaṃtāne kliśyante teṣāṃ tatra paridāho
’pi nāsti dharmayuktavipaśyanayā); thus those bodhisatvas are not stained by vices
because they see that vices are adventitious (tena te bodhisatvā na saṃkliśyanta āgantukakleśadarśanatvāt).As
this teaching was given the son of a banker Bhayadatta attained tolerance
in accordance with religion (asmin nirdeśe nirdiśyamāne bhayadattasya śreṣṭiputrasya
dharmeṣv anulomikī kṣāntir utpāditā), and as the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī
noticed that the son of a banker Bhayadatta had been educated, she, accompanied by about
five hundred divine girls, made symbals sound, music heard and songs sung, and she went
to the place where the Lord stayed, bowed her head to his feet, and sat down before him.
