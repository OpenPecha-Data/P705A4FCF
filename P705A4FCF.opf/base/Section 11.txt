Then the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī, having spoken these verses again bowed
her head to the feet of the princely Mañjuśrī, and, having again circumambulated the princely
Mañjuśrī, she ascended on to the cart with the son of a banker Bhayadatta, and went
with all those riches to the park.And the princely Mañjuśrī taught the whole of that assembly
by means of religious conversation, he made them take it to their hearts, made them rejoice
and made them happy (mañjuśrīḥ kumārabhūto ’pi sarvāvatīṃ parṣadaṃ dharmakathayā saṃprakāśayati
samādāpayati samuttejayati saṃpraharṣayati sma).And having taught them, made
them take it to their hearts, made them rejoice and made them happy, he said to them: “Friends,
those of you who wish to listen to religion should go to the True Being in the evening
time!” (ye mārṣā dharmaśravaṇkās te ’parāhnakālasamaye tathāgatasya purato gacchantu).As
he had said so they left that location, and all went to their separate places.
