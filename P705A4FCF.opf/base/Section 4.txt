IV. The courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī was content and elated, delighted and joyful, joy and
good temper was born with her, and, having done obeisance with her five limbs by falling
down before the feet of the princely Mañjuśrī, having taken refuge in the Buddha, his teachings
and his congregation, having adopted a chaste life and the moral commandments, having
produced the thought of the incomparable, perfect awakening with determination, she said
(suvarṇottaraprabhāśrī gaṇikāduhitā tṛptodagrāttamanāḥ pramuditā prītisaumanasyajātā pañcāṅgaiḥ
namaskṛtya mañjuśrīyaḥ kumārabhūtasya caraṇayor nipatya buddhadharmasaṅghān śaraṇaṃ
gatvā brahmacaryāṃ śikṣāpadāni ca samādāyādhyāśayenānuttarāyai samyaksaṃbodhaye cittam utpādayitvedam
avocat):

And I, Mañjuśrī, having heard your teaching, will produce the thought of the incomparable perfect
awakening for the sake of your teaching, for the sake of pity and compassion with all
beings, for the sake of not breaking the tradition of the Buddha, for the sake of not breaking
the tradition of the religon, for the sake of not breaking the tradition of the congregation
(ahaṃ tu, mañjuśrīs, tvadanuśāsanāyai sarvasatvānukampākaruṇāyai buddhavaṃsānupacchedāya
dharmavaṃsānupacchedāya saṃghavaṃsānupacchedāya tvadupadeśaṃ śrutvānuttarāyai samyaksaṃbodhaye
cittam utpādayiṣyāmi).In the same way, I will teach religion to all beings to
make them understand religion (evaṃ dharmapratipattaye sarvasatvebhyo dharmaṃ deśayiṣyāmi).To
purify the hindrances originated from sinful actions I will confess each sin according
to how it is done (duṣkṛtakarmāvaraṇapariśodhanāyātyayam atyayato deśayiṣye).When beings
do not understand that all moments of existence are peaceful and tranquil, they do not understand
the essential nature of moments of existence, since they are in the power of misunderstanding
preceded by non-fundamental thought and chained to desire by attachment to their
bodies (yatra sarvadharmaśāntyupaśāntim anadhigamya ayoniśomanasikārapūrvaṃgamaviparītavaśībhūtāḥ
svakāyābhiniveśena rāgasaṃprayuktāḥ satvā na dharmasvabhāvatām adhigacchanti)But,
Mañjuśrī, even though this is the case, also those beings chained to desire are attached
to exactly that state of things like it is (evaṃ mañjuśrīḥ bhavet te ’pi tu rāgasaṃprayuktāḥ
satvā yādṛśā iyaṃ dharmatā tayaiva yuktāḥ).And the bodhisatvas train themselves in
this dharma of attachment and produce the thought of the incomparable perfect awakening (bodhisatvā
asmin prayuktadharme śikṣante, anuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittāny utpādayanti).Why?
Mañjuśrī, the vices are not real, but born out of thought-constructions, and they disappear
when the thought-constructions are understood as something empty (tat kasya hetor,
na mañjuśrīḥ kleśā hi yathābhūtāḥ saṃkalpotpannāḥ, evaṃ saṃkalpaparibodhe nirudhyante yathāriktatvāt).As
I understand the meaning of what you say, Mañjuśrī, the vices are without any
essential nature and unborn, just like a mass of clouds (yathā mañjuśrīr mayā tvadbhāṣitārtho
’dhigataḥ kleśā hi niḥsvabhāvānutpannā meghasaṃghātasadṛśāḥ);the vices are broken up
and dissolved in an instant, just like bubbles (kleśā hi kṣaṇabhagnavilīnā budbudasadṛśāḥ);the
vices are not produced, just like wind (kleśā hy atyantānabhinirvṛttā vāyusadṛśāḥ);the
vices are beyond all spheres, just like a drawing in open space (kleśā hi sarvaviṣayasamatikrāntā
ākāśalekhasadṛśāḥ);the vices are not lasting, just like a drawing in water (kleśā
hy acirasthitikā udakalekhasadṛśāḥ);the vices are originated from entering wrong considerations,
just like demons and spirits (kleśā hy ayoniśomanasikārapraveśotpannā yakṣabhūtasadṛśāḥ);the
vices are originated from wrongly seeing things where there is nothing, just
like in a fever (kleśā hy abhūtaviparītadarśanotpannā uṣṇasadṛśāḥ).The vices are originted
from thought-constructions, and thus non-existent (kleśā hi saṃkalpotpannā abhūtāḥ);the
vices are connected to the inclinations of the ego (kleśā hy ahaṃkārenādhyavasānasaṃbaddhāḥ);the
vices are graping for the objects by the greed for possessions principle (kleśā hi
mamakārena vastuparigrahāḥ);the vices are adventitious since produced by misunderstandings
(kleśā hi mithyotpādenāgantukāḥ);the vices are following along the distingusishing marks
since a results of thought-constructions (kleśā hi vikalpotpādena nimittānusāriṇaḥ);the vices
are non-inspection since a state of non-reflection on the different spheres (kleśā hi
nānādhātvavicāranayenāpratyavekṣā);the vices, being originated in accordance with the thoughts,
are the absence of introspection (kleśā hi cittānulomikotpāditā anidhyaptiḥ);the vices,
originating from the attachment to self and others, are the absence of faith (kleśā hi
parātmābhiniveśotpannā asaṃpratyayāḥ);the vices are grasping for the parts of personality
(kleśā hi skandhopādānaḥ); the vices are holding on to the spheres of sense-perception as
material things (kleśā hi dhātupiṇḍagrahaḥ);the vices are amassing the fields of sense-perception
as material things (kleśā hi dhātupiṇḍagrahaḥ); the vices are making distinctions
between concepts and forms (kleśā hi nāmarūpapravicayaḥ);the vices are the absence of understanding
superficial considerations (kleśā hy ayoniśomanasikārānadhigamaḥ).

But even though that is the case, Mañjuśrī, the vices are the pillar basis of the awakening
(evaṃ mañjuśrīḥ bhavet kleśā api tu bodhikīlāśrayaḥ).Why? Because the awakening is immovable
(tat kasya hetor, bodhir acalā), and the vices are the seed of awakening – awakening is
really the understanding of the vices (kleśā hi bodhibījaṃ, kleśāvabodha eva bodhiḥ).And
the vices are the diamond basis of awakening (kleśās tu bodhivajrāśrayaḥ).Why? Because the
awakening, by the principle of being inseparable from the totality of reality, cannot be
cut by the vices (tat kasya hetor, dharmadhātvasaṃbhedanayena bodhiḥ kleśair asaṃbhinnā).Mañjuśrī,
seeing the vices is awakening, awakening belongs to any area (kleśadarśanaṃ mañjuśrīr
bodhiḥ, bodhiḥ sarvaviṣayānugatā).Mañjuśrī, as the awakening is not established anywhere,
thus also the vices are not established – they do not stay on as they are broken up and
melt away as soon as they have arisen (yathā mañjuśrīr bodhir avyavasthitā tathāpi kleśā
avyavasthitā utpannā bhagnavilīnā anavasthitāḥ).Mañjuśrī, the vices have thought as its
essential nature (kleśā mañjuśrīś cittasvabhāvāḥ).Why? Mañjuśrī, it is not possible to point
out the essential nature of thought by expressions as “this thought is full of desire,
full of aversion, full of bewilderment” (tat kasya hetor, na śakyaṃ mañjuśrīś idaṃ cittaṃ
raktaṃ vā dviṣṭaṃ vā mūḍhaṃ veti nidarśayituṃ cittasvabhāvaḥ).But, Mañjuśrī, as it is impossible
to demonstrate what is thought, it is also not possible to point out the essential
nature of the vices by expressions as “the vices are found in certain places and regions”
(yathā mañjuśrīr na śakyaṃ cittaṃ nidarśayituṃ tathāpi na śakyaṃ kleśā deśasthā vā pradeśasthā
veti nidarśayituṃ kleśasvabhāvaḥ).

A bodhisatva, Mañjuśrī, a great being, to the extent he penetrates the vices, to that extent
he does not get tired in bringing to maturity beings behaving according to desire, not those
behaving according to aversion, not those behaving according to bewilderment, he does
not get tired in bringing to maturity beings behaving according to the three vices in equal
combination (bodhisatvo mañjuśrīr mahāsatvo yathā yathā tān kleśān pratividhyate tathā tathā
na sa rāgacaritānāṃ satvānāṃ paripācanayā parikhidyate, na dveṣacaritānāṃ, na mohacaritānāṃ,
na sabhāgacaritānāṃ satvānāṃ paripācanayā parikhidyate).Thus, Mañjuśrī, I will look
upon my own desire in the same way as upon the desire of all those behaving according to
desire (evaṃ mañjuśrīr yathātmarāgaṃ tathā sarveṣāṃ rāgacaritānāṃ rāgaṃ darśayiṣyāmi);thus,
Mañjuśrī, I will look upon my own aversion in the same way as upon the aversion of all
those behaving according to aversion (evaṃ mañjuśrīr yathātmadveṣaṃ tathā sarveṣāṃ dveṣacaritānāṃ
dveṣaṃ darśayiṣyāmi);thus, Mañjuśrī, I will look upon my own bewilderment in the same
way as upon the bewilderment of all those behaving according to bewilderment (evaṃ mañjuśrīr
yathātmamohaṃ tathā sarveṣāṃ mohacaritānāṃ mohaṃ darśayiṣyāmi);thus, Mañjuśrī, I will
look upon my own vices in the same way as upon the vices of all those behaving according
to vices (evaṃ mañjuśrīr yathātmakleśān tathā sarveṣāṃ kleśacaritānāṃ kleśān darśayiṣyāmi).

Just as, Mañjuśrī, the fire is not scared by all grass and trees; in the same way, Mañjuśrī,
the fire of saintly insight is not scared by all the grass and trees of vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr
nāgnis sarvatṛṇakāṣṭair bhītaḥ, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñāgniḥ sarvakleśatṛṇakāṣṭair
bhītaḥ).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the disk of the sun does not stay in the company of darkness;
in the same way, Mañjuśrī, saintly insight does not stay in the company of vices (tadyathā
mañjuśrīr na sūryamaṇḍalaṃ tamo’ndhakāreṇa sārdhaṃ saṃvasati, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñā
sarvakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the wind does not cling to trees
and mountains; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly
insight does not cling to any region of vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr na mārutaḥ vṛkṣaparvataiḥ
saktaḥ, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaviṣayaiḥ saktaḥ).Just
as, Mañjuśrī, the element of space does not get burnt by all the fire of the world conflagration;
in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does
not get burnt by all the fire of the world conflagration of vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr nākāśadhātuḥ
sarvakalpaparidāhena dahyate, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ
sarvakleśakalpaparidāhena dahyate).Just as, Mañjuśrī, as space does not stay in the company
of dust, mist and clouds; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to
saintly insight does not stay in the company of any vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr nākāśaṃ rajomahikāmeghaiḥ
sārdhaṃ saṃvasati, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaiḥ
sārdhaṃ saṃvasati).Just as, Mañjuśrī, as space does not stay in the company of earth;
in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does not stay
in the company of any vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr nākāśaṃ pṛthivyā sārdhaṃ saṃvasati, evam
eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati).Just as, Mañjuśrī,
as the loadstone does not stay in the company of iron; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the
bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight does not stay in the company of any vices
(tadyathā mañjuśrīr nāyaskānto ’yobhiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito
bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaiḥ sārdhaṃ saṃvasati).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the mountain Cakravāḍa
cannot be shaken by all the winds; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according
to saintly insight cannot be shaken by all the vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr na cakravāḍaḥ
sarvavāyubhiḥ kampayituṃ śakyate, evam eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ sarvakleśaiḥ
kampayituṃ śakyate).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the bird goose from the animal world drinks
the milk and not the water from a mixture of milk and water; in the same way, Mañjuśrī,
the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight takes out the insight and not the vices
from a mixture of saintly insight and vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr haṃsa iti tiryagyonigataḥ
pakṣī kṣīravārimiśrāt kṣīram eva pibati na vāri, evam eva mañjuśrīr āryaprajñācarito bodhisatva
āryaprajñākleśamiśrāt prajñām eva gṛhṇāti na kleśān).Just as, Mañjuśrī, in the northern
continent the tree branches will not bow down to women who have sexual relations with
relatives; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight
does not bow down to those living beings whose organs are immature.Thus, Mañjuśrī, I have
no fears for the vices (evam mañjuśrīr nāsti me kleśais trāsabhayam). Why? The bodhisatvas,
Mañjuśrī, are clad in the armour of fearlessness (tat kasya hetor, bodhisatvā mañjuśrīr
abhayasaṃnāhasaṃnaddhāḥ).Just as, Mañjuśrī, one cannot call a hero one that fears the enemy;
in the same way, Mañjuśrī, one cannot call a bodhisatva one that fears the vices (tadyathā
mañjuśrīr yaḥ śatruṇā trasto na sa śūra ity ucyate, evam eva mañjuśrīr yaḥ kleśais trasto
na sa bodhisattva ity ucyate).Just as, Mañjuśrī, one cannot call a hero one that is conquered
by the enemy; in the same way, Mañjuśrī, one cannot call a bodhisatva one that is
conquered by the vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr yaḥ śatruṇā jito na sa śūra ity ucyate, evam eva
mañjuśrīr yaḥ kleśais jito na sa bodhisatva ity ucyate).Just as, Mañjuśrī, the jewel called
“waterpurifyer” purifies all the dirt in the water when thown into the water without
getting sticky and without being sullied by the impurities in the water; in the same way,
Mañjuśrī, the bodhisatva acting according to saintly insight, even if he is situated among
the vices, he purifies all the impurities in the vices without getting sticky and without
being sullied by the impurities in the vices (tadyathā mañjuśrīr udakaprasādikaṃ nāma maṇiratnaṃ
na vāriprakṣiptaṃ snighdaṃ na jalamalopaliptaṃ sarvajalakāluṣyaṃ prasādayati, evam
eva mañjuśrīr nāryaprajñācarito bodhisatvaḥ kleśasthito ’pi snigdho na kleśamalopaliptaḥ
sarvakleśakāluṣya praśamayati).
