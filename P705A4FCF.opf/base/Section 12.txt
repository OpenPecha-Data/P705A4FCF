Then the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī and the son of a banker Bhayadatta went
together to the park, where bunches of flowers were spread everywhere, yielding fragrance
(pradhūpita), there were awnings (vitānaka) decorated with parasols, banners and ensigns
(chattradhvajapatākavibhuṣita).Having prepared riches of food and drink they stayed in the
park as they resorted to drums cymbals and songs for amusement (nandakrīḍānulomikatūryatāḍāvacarasaṃgīti).As
they had eaten and drunk they got quite intoxicated (pramatta), and
the daughter of a courtesan Suvarṇottamaprabhāśrī fell asleep on a pillow (śīropadhāna) on
the lap of Bhayadatta, the son of a banker.Then that girl displayed her body as withered
by means of the power of supernormal knowledge, and she produced the concept that she was
dead (atha sā dārikābhijñābalena svakāyaṃ mlānaṃ darśayitvā sā maraṇasaṃjñām utpādayati sma).Her
whole body became impure and appeared as a rotting corpse, from the two openings of
the ears, from the eyes, and from the interior of the nose came ill-smelling impurities and
spread all over her body (sarva tasyāḥ kāyo ’śubho ’bhavat, yathā kuṇapam adarśayat, tasyāḥ
karṇapuṭayoś cakṣurindriyayoś ca ghrāṇāntarāc ca durgandha utpannaḥ, utpadya ca sarva
kāyo vyāptyaḥ).From the interior of her mouth came a foul odour, and the whole park was filled
with the odour (tasyāḥ mukhāntarād durgandha utpadyati sma, tair durgandhaiḥ sarva udyāno
vyāptaḥ).From every pore flowed blood and pus (sarvaromakupāc ca rudhiraḥ pūyaḥ prasravanti
sma), and from the abdomen, with the navel in the middle, the liver and all the intestines
appeared (chidrodaraṇābhimadhyād sarvayakṛdantrā utpadyanti sma), excrements and
urine appeared from her anus and vulva and flowed out, from her head the brain flowed out,
and blue flies began creeping on the nails of her feet and hands (pāyūpasthād uccāraprasrāvaḥ
prasravati, mūrdhno mastiṣkaḥ prasravati sma, pādahastāṅguliṣu nīlamakṣikāś calati sma).And
Bhayadatta, the son of a banker, saw the body of the girl having turned into such a
condition, and having seen it he became taken by fear and became terrified, having no protection
and support, no resort, he sought protection, greatly frightened he trembled and cried
bitterly (atha śreṣṭhiputro bhayadattas tasyā dārikāyāḥ kāyam evamavasthām āpannaṃ dadarśa,
dṛṣṭvā ca bhayārdita udvigno ’śaraṇo ’nāśrayo ’paryāpannaḥ śaraṇaiśī mahābhayabhūtaḥ
pravepamāṇaś cakranda).The reasons why such great fear arose in him are two (dvau hetau
tanmahābhayotpādasya): He was a person outside religious life, and he had a vision of the
crimes which is connected with such fear (pṛthagjana āsīt, tān bhayasya doṣān ca dadarśa).“As
recompensation for this girl king Ajātaśatru will kill me”, he thought, and putting the
girl off from his lap he tried to escape, but did not manage (sa rājājātaśatrur yāvad asyā
dārikāyāḥ pratikāreṇa māṃ haniṣyatīti tāṃ dārikām utsaṅgāt tyaktvā niṣpalāyitum ārabdho
nāśaknot).And all his fellows, seeing that great terrible fear, also ran away (tasya parivāro
’pi mahābhīmabhayaṃ dṛṣṭvā niṣpalāyitāḥ).Then, being alone and without friends, he sat
down thinking: “Who is going to free me, who is afflicted by such a great fear, from this,
a god, a snake god, a meateating demon, a celestial musician, a giant, a divine bird, a
man-horse, a great snake, a man, a non-man, a monk or a brahmin?” (atha sa ekāky asahāyaḥ
sa subhayabhīto ko māṃ mahābhayabhītam asmān mocayiṣyati devo vā nāgo vā yakṣo vā gandharvo
vāsuro vā garuḍo vā kiṃnaro vā mahrago vā mānuṣyo vāmanuṣyo vā bhikṣur vā brāhmaṇo vety
asthāt).
